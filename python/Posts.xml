  <row Id="14" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="3" CreationDate="2010-07-14T23:34:43.680" Score="87" Body="&lt;p&gt;I feel quite strongly that GameDev should cover &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; aspects of &quot;game &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (note the site isn't called &quot;game &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt;&quot;), which should absolutely include programming. Just because there's another SE site that already covers some related topic (i.e. SO in the case of programming), doesn't mean that the content doesn't belong here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My reasoning is that although the &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; of two sites may have some overlap, the &lt;strong&gt;audiences&lt;/strong&gt; may not. If I want to know about a specific DirectX API call, or tips on doing efficient 3D matrix transforms, I'm &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more likely to get a relevant/complete answer from professional game developers than I am to get them from a broader programming audience (even though they're &quot;programming questions&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that GameDev should cover questions relating to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Game design (architecture, gameplay, ideas, mechanics, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Game assets (creation, storage, editing, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Game programming (coding, bugs, best practices, patterns, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Game development (testing, team development, tools, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Game release (hosting, publishing, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Game industry (careers, trends, technology, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I do agree, that at some point there will be a line where questions become too general and are probably better migrated to SO (or some other SE site). Basically we need to come up with a nice simple single rule that we can apply objectively to a given question to determine whether it's on/off topic. For example, on SO you can apply the question: &quot;If I replaced the word 'programming' with the word 'knitting', would this still belong on SO&quot;. (so &quot;What music do you listen to while programming?&quot; is a bad SO question since &quot;What music do you listen to while knitting?&quot; is clearly unrelated to programming).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For GameDev I think that defining question is: &quot;Would a professional game developer give me a better/different/more specific answer to this question than other programmers?&quot;. For example if I'm asking about a specific game engine API, then SO is probably not the best choice, since it's unlikely you'll find enough people with the right exposure (different audience). If I'm asking about, say, a path finding algorithm, SO is probably not the right choice since if its for a game, you'll probably trade off some accuracy for more efficiency (different needs/goals). But if you're asking how to reverse the order of an array, then a game developer is going to give the same answer as any other programmer, so it probably belongs on SO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Buy hey, that's just my 2c...

One thing to think about is this: is there a subgroup of firearm owners that are more than just dilettantes? Think about why MathOverflow is so much better than Yahoo! Math Answers... it's because it attracts professional mathematicians. Can you narrow the target audience from &quot;people interested into firearms&quot; to something like &quot;professional firearm dealers&quot;? Or &quot;military firearm maintenance officers?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You'll still get all the people interested in firearms, but because of the heavy presence of professionals, you'll get much higher level conversation. Rather than &quot;What are the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit in [state]&quot;, which already has an excellent Wikipedia article, you'll get questions like, &quot;How do I authenticate a genuine 1911 Pacific Theater commemorative Colt?&quot; which doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The power of the Stack Exchange platform is detailed, expert answers to extremely rare, &quot;long-tail,&quot; highly technical questions. To get expert answers, you need experts. To attract experts, you need a site where people are asking very interesting and hard questions, not the basic questions, so that it's clear that this is a PRO site, not a consumer/enthusiast site.... and remember, the pro sites WILL attract the enthusiasts, but not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Problem: NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it's going to be difficult to get the kind of long-tail questions that really drive professionals to the site.  Most of the major players in hardware and software put developers under pretty stringent NDAs.  Posting anything about the Wii/PS3/Xbox/beta iPhone SDKs isn't really something people can do.  That's probably true for most game engine licenses as well.  And there's the idea that a lot of proprietary tech is considered a valuable trade secret.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So a lot of the questions on the site now are high level subjective design questions.  The engines and platforms that aren't under NDAs are generally considered indie/enthusiast (i.e. XNA, Unity, UDK).  Non-domain-specific programming specific questions usually are the domain of SO.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't really have a specific question to ask.

Finally, as game development is changing relatively quickly many of these list questions could actually need new answers within a year or less. By allowing the users to add  new answers we can use this site to keep nice resources lists to solve a variety of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my personal view is to force these questions to be community wiki, and to proactively close duplicate list questions. Other than that I think they are a positive for the site as a whole and advance the general cause of sharing information within the game development community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="162" LastActivityDate="2010-07-31T05:45:43.583" CommentCount="1" />

Clearly, for some programming questions, context is important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kind of programming problems that come up here on the GameDev site (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/3656/data-structures-for-interpolation-and-threading&quot;&gt;example of mine&lt;/a&gt;) are very different to those that come up on Stack Overflow (&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1353456/recompile-c-while-running-without-appdomains&quot;&gt;another example of mine&lt;/a&gt; - game related but better on SO). Or at very least &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And obviously there will be some fuzzyness. And it would be good if we had a way to punt questions between the two sites. But that is a small price to pay for the value of having a pool of domain-specific knowledge on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(And it almost goes without saying that there are many other aspects of game development - art and business to name two big categories - that are clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; suited to Stack Overflow).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="288" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:37:42.347" LastActivityDate="2010-09-11T13:42:28.707" CommentCount="0" />

I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/&quot;&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt; and I'll be working on the designs for the Stack Exchange sites as they graduate from the beta phase. Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflects its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After studying the type of questions on the site, I realized that Game Dev is such a broad field! It's more than just programming or graphics. It's a combination of both and so much more. My initial ideas were to have the design mimic the 3d modeling software interface, or programming tool's IDE UI(gray, technical etc). After talking to some friends who work in the industry, they informed me that they actually don't like the UI of their tools. What one friend said really inspired me, to quote him:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Programmers think they are artists and&#xA;  fine craftsmen, and I think that Game&#xA;  Devs are even more so. It’s not a&#xA;  cold, technical job. It’s a vibrant,&#xA;  living work of art.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I visited many game programming and art sites out there for design ideas. Unfortunately, most of them are rather poorly designed php bulletin boards. Luckily, I found some good inspirations in gaming magazines. The design goal is to keep the site structure you're familiar with, but adding a graphical &quot;shell&quot; to it that reflects the vibrancy of game development. The design should be inviting to new users who are interested in Game Dev, and in long term it should fade in the background as a &quot;pleasant noise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/W6F0X.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/W6F0X.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;click image above to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/W6F0X.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;full res version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted the header area to be eye-catching, to offset an otherwise rather simple site. I think a CGed graphical header works here. I rendered the scene Cloud City from Bryce. The polygon fading to full render symbolizes conception to delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the background is a subtle engineering paper pattern. Game dev is just as technical than it is artistic, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130/logo-proposals-for-game-development&quot;&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; Sean James came up with. I like the idea of having RGB in the logo, since they're the basic building blocks of anything graphical. Building blocks is the message I'm going after in the logo. I also like the hexgon shapes since they remind me of gaming magazines visuals as long as I can remember. You will see several occurrences of it through out the site. I'm using it on accepted answer background, tags and badges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe this design direction works very well for the Game Dev site. It provides a good balance of eye-candy and content. It adds new elements to the site while keeping the familiar structure.

Granted if you &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; to be a lawyer you'll get in trouble, but that's why people include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acronymfinder.com/I-Am-Not-A-Lawyer-(IANAL).html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;IANAL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, as to whether we (gamedev) &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be either answering, or asking legal questions - I think it's question-specific. Some questions will be too technical, and require a lawyer - but some questions, &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; require any major legal knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't need a medical degree to tell someone that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/reyes-syndrome/ds00142&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome in children&lt;/a&gt;, and you don't need a law degree to tell someone that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/3937/using-modified-copyrighted-music-in-non-commercial-games/3942#3942&quot;&gt;copyright violation (of music) is illegal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone asks such a &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; legal question, that can be answered by quoting any of dozens of current copyright websites, I don't see a problem with the question. Assuming it's game-related, of course. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the legal question gets more complex, it obviously falls more out of our domain (and gets too person-specific anyway), so it would be an off-topic question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you draw the line?&lt;/strong&gt; That's something we're still trying to answer for a lot of topics :) But I don't think the answer is &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; - I think &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; legal (game-related) question can be valid and on-topic for this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to whether any given legal question would be useful to others, I think they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be - even if only to inform other devs that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a legal issue that they need address, before releasing their game (and maybe before &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; the game they can fix the issue beforehand).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="165" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.667" LastActivityDate="2010-11-07T16:21:52.983" CommentCount="7" />

Audio- and video-editing software for soundtrack/effects and cut-scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most if not all of these tools have something in common: You don't use them exclusively for game production.

It probably does not need black-listing, just the initial destruction to remove it from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally I'm a promotor of singular combo tags, but in this scenario I'm actually leaning towards the former. Browsing &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/strategy&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;strategy&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; shows a lot of questions about the Strategy genre that can be safely abstracted from the game's being real-time versus turn-based. Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/turn-based&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;turn-based&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;turn-based&lt;/a&gt; can be applied to other genres, most predominantly RPG. Those two tags have important meaning to be used on their own as a result, and their combination is literally identical in meaning to the combined tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike with what I see on the Gaming Stack Exchange, there seems to be no huge ambiguity as to what &quot;strategy&quot; means - to game developers it applies to the genre. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/8643/is-there-any-simple-game-that-involves-psychological-factors&quot; title=&quot;It feels like a throwaway tag&quot;&gt;one exception&lt;/a&gt;, but it needs a big retag and otherwise does not seem like it should trend dangerously. Most &quot;unit strategy&quot; questions actually properly get tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ai&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ai&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turn-based strategy is a much more defined genre compared to, say, turn-based RPGs. You could easily get away with tagging things as RPG without needing to differentiate the different expressions of it, but being turn-based versus real-time is often part of the soul and definition of a strategy game. So a preference to keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/turn-based-strategy&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;turn-based-strategy&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;turn-based-strategy&lt;/a&gt; is more than understandable. But if this is the case, then it feels like something should be done about the other two tags instead. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3588" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.667" LastActivityDate="2011-04-12T13:28:04.253" CommentCount="0" CommunityOwnedDate="2011-04-12T13:17:44.530" />

When a question is clear and directed, a duplicate is usually obvious and can serve as a marker to the real question and answers. An open-ended, poor question is harder to isolate duplicates for. This leads to either questions with overlapping answers, spreading out the information (a thing we close questions as duplicates to help avoid) &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; it leads to questions being closed but the duplicates only touching on the kind of information the asker really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular domain, it tends to be the case that beginner-type questions tend to be the most open-ended and inappropriate for the Q&amp;amp;A style format.

It is the only non-answer way to actually communicate with someone. And a person who doesn't accept answers needs to be communicated with. If not comments, how would you suggest informing someone about the accept feature if they don't know about it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I admit that people talking about accept rates does sound like someone trolling for rep. After all, accepted answers are not only worth +15 rep, that's +15 that doesn't get capped at 200. But in general, it is perfectly fine to mention someone's accept rate in a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are extenuating circumstances that can make it inappropriate. It is entirely possible that a person simply hasn't received many satisfactory answers. Perhaps they asked several questions that went unanswered, or the answers were unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, on to the more specific question: Where do you personally stand on this? I know you didn't ask, but you did use yourself as a specific example. So you left the door open for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You've asked 8 questions. You have accepted 1 answer. Namely, &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt;. FYI: accepting an answer to your own question doesn't give you rep. That's not to say it's wrong; it's perfectly fine if you feel that your answer is the most correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, let's look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/9537/pen-tablet-input-for-fps&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; that you answered yourself. It may be telling of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your answer was specific to Win32, using Win32 functions and such. Yet your question never once mentioned Win32. To be fair, you did tag the question Windows, but there is a difference between &quot;developing on Windows&quot; and &quot;directly using the Win32 API&quot;. For example, since this is a game development site, &quot;developing on Windows&quot; could easily mean that you use DirectInput.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So your question was incomplete. That is why you did not get appropriate answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second question that received multiple answers was &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/11949/key-combinations-on-poll-based-input&quot;&gt;the one about keyboard combinations&lt;/a&gt;. The comment under your question asked for something very simple: clarification on your API of choice for input. You did not reply, nor did you provide this information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, you received several very good answers, detailing how to go about doing exactly what you asked for. There is no reason you could not have marked one of those as an accepted answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/6403/microsoft-and-media-using-the-new-stuff&quot;&gt;this question about DirectX versions&lt;/a&gt;. Quite frankly, that is not a question; that is a &lt;em&gt;rant&lt;/em&gt; disguised as a question. It's about you not liking that Microsoft is trying to phase out a 10 year old OS by not allowing newer technologies and APIs to run on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can tell this not just by the language you use to ask the &quot;question&quot; (for example, the pointless use of bold-face text for &quot;if you're running Windows 7!&quot;), but also by how you respond to answers that don't agree. AttackingHobo pointed you to the Steam Survey about DX10 availability, and your first response was to talk about the much smaller DX11 availability. Why? DX11 is only a minor change to the DX10 (in terms of the overall API. Most DX10 code can run as DX11 with at worst a couple of changes), so if you want to code to DX10, there's no real issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You did not find any of the answers acceptable, even though most of them made strong points. Granted, as your question was less a question and more a rant, it's hard to say what qualifies as &quot;acceptable&quot;. Even so, the blame rests on you for posting a rant rather than a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I find the tone of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/14115/do-i-need-the-w-component-in-my-vector-class&quot;&gt;this question on having a W component&lt;/a&gt; to be... defensive. It sounds like a question that you ask when you think you're discovered something cleverer than most of the code you've seen. Look at those silly guys, carrying around 4D vectors, when I can make do with 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since nobody agreed with this notion, nobody got the accept check. Indeed, Maik made a great point that torpedoes your idea entirely for any use of SSE or similar vector intrinsics. You would lose lots of efficiency by trying to do matrix multiplies your way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this is not mindless bashing of you. I could very well be wrong about any of the previously stated ideas about your questions. But it seems to me that some of your questions are looking for validation for ideas you already have, rather than actual unknowns that you want answers to. And thus, when you don't get that validation, because others have different opinions about things, you simply don't accept the answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other questions of your seem poorly specified. As such, nobody posts an acceptable answer because you haven't asked the question very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore yes, I would say that it is entirely appropriate for you to be called out on your accept history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8240" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.487" LastActivityDate="2011-08-12T08:31:29.480" CommentCount="3" />

To a newbie, it means, &quot;Someone here didn't like me.&quot; To another person, it means, &quot;This question is not helpful.&quot; To another, it means, &quot;This question does not fulfill my criteria of being 'good'.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One good aspect of forums is that there's exactly one means of communication: replying to a post.

Or to select an already written comment that effectively adds 1 to its total.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a site like Stack Overflow, it's really very simple, because questions there are almost always narrow, focused, etc. You have a programming problem. You go to SO to get a solution. You can look at all of the questions and see answers to them. You can see what questions others ask, so you might ask one in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People go to SO if they have a problem. But people don't see GDSE that way. They want to think of it in terms of a forum. You'll get people who just decided one day to &quot;make a game&quot;, so they see a game development site and start posting. They don't want Q&amp;A; they want to talk. They want interaction. They want &lt;em&gt;dialog&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we're going to be a Q&amp;amp;A site for game developers, we have to stop those questions. They have to be shut down and closed.

Communities are about communication, and forums do that very well. For dedicated Q&amp;amp;A sites, this is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more difficult. Communication, by the very design of the site, is restricted and rigid. How people communicate is muddled and non-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your question gets closed, you don't get an answer, period. Your question hasn't gone away; the site simply said, &quot;NO!&quot; and left you in the cold. Maybe you get a couple of comments linking to tutorials or other off-site information, but that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to put it another way. There is a difference between Q&amp;amp;A, and getting &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt;.

The IGDA has, in the past, provided a good way for non-developers to interact with a tiny quantity of professional developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have found, however, that official &quot;get togethers&quot; and knowledge exchanges tend to have significantly more students, indies, and wanna-be's than professional developers.

That's really hard to do.

Look all the way back to the hackers in the 60's, optimizing the crap out of their programs so that they would run faster than their peers'. Nowadays we're not so much into optimization of code any more, but there's a growing industry obsession with optimization of workflow - see for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehacker.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lifehacker&lt;/a&gt;. But there's always the tendency to always want the &quot;best&quot; anything, and unlike in the real world where &quot;best&quot; is usually not clear or things generally have downsides, in the computer world things are abstract and just made of data.

Absolutely not. &lt;em&gt;Any answer&lt;/em&gt; given will be based entirely on opinion, because there is no &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to learn anything. I, for one, believe that the Superbible version 5 is not a particularly great learning guide because I disagree with its teaching methods. Does that make me &quot;right&quot;?

Indeed, I would say that the current accepted answer is fantastically bad, because learning from samples encourages copy-and-paste coding. Learning best involves real instruction, not &quot;here's some code that does this!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that's just my opinion. That isn't &quot;the answer&quot;, because the question &lt;em&gt;cannot be answered definitively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is no right answer, then it's not a question: it's an invitation for discussion.

It's like trying to explain quantum mechanics over text-messages), that way should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be to ask a &quot;question&quot; that isn't really a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A part of the site needs to be sacrosanct. That's what makes Stack Exchange good: that it focuses on getting answers to real, &lt;em&gt;answerable&lt;/em&gt; questions. And the vast majority of &quot;best&quot; questions are not answerable. They're debate. They're discussion. They're opinion. They're dialog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fine for a forum. But Stack Exchange is &lt;em&gt;not a forum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every non-question that remains open is an invitation for others to post non-questions.

Explore other languages, other paradigms, other ways of approaching problems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn from smart people -- Don't code in isolation.  Get involved in an open source project, find a local hacker group, participate in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;online site about programming&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  Find a way to learn from people smarter than you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Develop your communication skills -- You need to be able to communicate your ideas to other programmers.  You also need to be able to communicate with &lt;em&gt;non-programmers&lt;/em&gt; (and this is usually way harder, but equally important)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn other stuff -- Don't just program, also study things like economics, writing, and math.  All of these will come in handy, to some extent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ship something -- It won't ever be perfect, but get it out the door.

So here's my list of important skills, from that perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;For a Programmer&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know how to talk to artists. Game designers are generally easier to deal with, but getting through to artists (depending on what field of programing you're involved in) is oftentimes hard. Artists are not like you. Even if they have similar nerdish interests to you, they do not think like you. If your programming duties often push you into contact with artists (ie: you're doing anything with graphics, animation, AI, or sound. So, yeah, probably a lot), you are going to have to learn how to translate things that have meaning for you into terms they understand. And vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most important of all, &lt;em&gt;be patient&lt;/em&gt; with artists. They're smart people; they're just looking at things from a different perspective. If they don't get it when you tell them something, assume that it's your fault and try again. One of the best ways to understand artists is to spend some time in an artists shoes: make an art asset. Grab 3DS Max or Blender or whatever, and make a model. Texture it. Animate it. Good luck with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, BTW ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debugging. Especially for console developers, debugging skills are absolutely paramount. Consoles these days certainly have a lot, &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more debugging functions than they used to (and those who've coded on older boxes know what I'm talking about). But you're still going to have to know how to use them to track down problems. If you've never had to track down hard debugging tasks like random memory corruption, learn. Oh, and good luck with that, BTW ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem solving. The fundamental foundation of all programming is problem solving. You should probably be good at this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know how to program broadly. As part of a programming team on an existing codebase, you are going to be asked to write code in a style that you may not entirely agree with. Maybe you think that smart pointers, RAII, and exceptions are God's gift to C++ programmers. That's great; I totally agree. But if your project as a whole isn't using it, then your code's going to stick out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, if you want to deviating significantly from the established standards of the codebase, talk to your lead first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;For an Artist&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask for things. I have found that artists sometimes have a tendency to accept that their current tools are as good as they're ever going to get, and they just deal with the pain points. Don't be that person. If your development studio has people who work on tools, ask for them to address some annoyance. Those people exist to make your jobs easier, but more often than not, they don't use those tools themselves. If you don't have a dedicated tools team, find out who is responsible for maintaining the tools and talk to them about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn to talk to programmers. Same deal as above; they're not like you. Their problem solving space is digital, quantified, and precise. Yours isn't. If a programmer lapses into technobabble, let them know that they're talking about something you don't get. Again, be patient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, to better understand them, take up a scripting language. I suggest Lua, which is both easy to learn and powerful. Try to write something fairly large and complex in that. You'll be better able to appreciate it when a programmer says that something will be &quot;hard&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;For a Producer&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time management. &lt;strong&gt;Time Management!&lt;/strong&gt; Markdown and HTML5 doesn't have enough emphasis for this; I need the old Blink tag back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the projects that I've been on that had extended crunch periods did so because of poor time management from production. Features would be cut late in development, well past the time when the writing was on the wall for them. Tech would come online late in development, forcing a scramble to properly integrate it, which won't have been factored into the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The job of the producer is to insure that production proceeds smoothly. That everyone is getting done what needs to get done, so that the next part can get done, so that the whole thing can get out the door well put together and on-time. Your entire job is time management. Please learn it ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that there is an understanding of how new pieces fit into the overall whole by everyone involved. When some new piece of tech comes online, make sure that the people making it know exactly where it needs to go and how it needs to fit into the existing framework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anytime new things happen, make sure everyone knows when they happen, how they happen, what they're for, and how they will be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIME MANAGEMENT.

There seem to exist some elements of our community who consistently abuse the system by making it &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; as if their question they are putting forward is one thing, when really, it's a whole lot things which they are either too lazy to think about enough to break into smaller problems/questions (the all-too-common &quot;Do it for me&quot; syndrome), or which they refuse to post on a discussion forum (like, as I always comment, gamedev.net). And don't try to tell me they don't know. They are well aware of the Q&amp;amp;A format -- they've used this site and that is how they know to come here in the first place. These users reckon that if they can just slip it in there under a title which describes just one small portion of the discussion they wish to have, then they will get someone to give them assistance, and have a nice old chat to boot. And sadly, given the rush for upvotes and desire to assist those who know less amongst the established users of the site, these discussion-instigators are usually correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem, as those established users all know, is that this devalues the site by making the search for relevant content that much harder.&lt;/strong&gt; Content is no longer clear-cut. It becomes less of a community resource, and more of a mess pandering to individual users' problems. Why then have a Q&amp;amp;A format at all?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am guilty of answering such questions from time to time, in fact two days ago I answered just such a one. And I am sorry that I did. In fact I voted to close it, not long after answering it. In my experience, it is rarely worth bothering to answer those kinds of questions. There are several reasons for that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It takes up a lot of time because the OP doesn't even begin to understand the problem, such that after one has written a lengthy answer to address the various possibilities, the OP will tend to ask extensive further questions for clarification... in other words, the question is too broad to answer effectively on the first try, and perhaps even thereafter;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other users will (I think) in the first place often avoid making their mark on questions that don't seem out-and-out poor, but are just not very clear;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It sets a trend for newbies to come onto this site and post questions that really do not belong here, because essentially an unclear question is a discussion-oriented one, and belongs on a forum, not a Q&amp;amp;A site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the question is framed as a programming question as stated above, it is taking relevant content away from SO (if it isn't there already) and duplicating it here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love SO. And I love gamedev.se. They both clearly serve different purposes. Is this so difficult for some people to understand? I guess so. I guess all they see are potential handouts, and they come running without thinking twice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there are ways to overcome the number of poor questions we receive on this site. I'm not sure that the measures already in place to filter poor questions are sufficient.

Since it didn't have any answers on Stack Overflow, it might get more love here, and produce better content overall, which is the primary goal of the Stack Exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) If the question is old, and has an accepted answer, massively upvoted or has answers that are massively upvoted, then I wouldn't bother to request to have it moved unless it's &lt;em&gt;specifically off topic&lt;/em&gt; for Stack Overflow (meaning it deals with a specialization dealing with game design and really isn't a language/non-game-specific framework issue).  If it's off topic for Stack Overflow, we simply don't want it.  But if it's on-topic, we generally don't want to shake things unless it's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember, if you take really old, highly upvoted content from Stack Overflow, you think it might be great, because you are getting a valuable piece of content.  However, when you see it lingering around on the front page for months, and your site becomes associated with &lt;em&gt;those singular questions&lt;/em&gt; instead of the nitty-gritty of game development, you'll find those questions can be more of a burden than a boon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This exact thing happened at Programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, in these specific cases, let the question live here, the person obviously is or is interested in getting the perspective from a game development point of view, and it helps to build your community.  Remember, &lt;em&gt;we like dupes&lt;/em&gt;, as asking questions in different ways helps increase the organic search hits on a topic.  If those &quot;dupes&quot; happen to be across sites in the network, then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are always special-cases, but they are exactly that, special, and should be considered on a per-question basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regards to the questions above on Stack Overflow, I'd say some house cleaning is in order (some dupe closing, some not a real question) but all in all, I don't see any reason why these &lt;em&gt;couldn't&lt;/em&gt; be moved, but the gamedev mods should speak to the SO mods specifically about that.  I just wouldn't expect &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; related to game development to be moved over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; moved over, please make sure that the appropriate questions are closed as duplicates.

Here's some tips for people who are just getting started (assuming developer = programmer in this case).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start small. If you've never programmed anything before, spend some&#xA;time learning a basic language or two (python, javascript, or&#xA;actionscript are good options). Don't just start using C++ or even&#xA;XNA because &quot;that's what the professionals use&quot;. Learn the basics so&#xA;you know about variables, arrays, functions, loops, objects, classes.&#xA;Then you can start learning how to make games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you start making games, again, start small. Make a basic text adventure. Make Tetris, or Breakout. Make a game where you avoid bigger squares and &quot;eat&quot; the smaller ones. Make Pac-man. Join an event like Ludum Dare or Global Game Jam, where you spend a weekend making a game based around a theme. Do this enough and you'll get an     understanding of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; games are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can start making the actual game of your dreams. For a small, simple game (World of Goo, Lyle in Cube Sector, Terraria, Braid), you're looking at something like 6 months to a year of development time, depending on exactly how complex your game is, and how much time you can devote to it per day/week/month. If you're thinking of making World of Warcraft, then go back a step and make Tetris again, because making WoW will take you 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6558" LastActivityDate="2012-02-01T15:18:33.967" CommentCount="0" />

I think a lot of game programmers want more visibility, want to make that contribution that makes people say &quot;Wauw!&quot;, they definitely don't want to be the ones who say that's not possible/feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, for every feature added there is going to be a statistical number of bugs that needs fixing. The number of bugs added per feature will rise with code complexity and stress level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try to add too many features and the game will be buggy, try to add too many features and then some, and you get Sword of the Stars II.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus if the programming team fails to say no (or someone in charge fails to interpret &quot;no&quot; as no) when too many features are requested the predictable result is that the programming teams contribution ends up being very notorious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was a bit of a rant, but I hope it tells something useful about being a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3505" LastActivityDate="2012-02-01T22:36:37.003" CommentCount="0" />

(note: #1 was closed 1 hour 34 minutes after it was posted. Which is pretty reasonable for a site this size).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Question 9 has been on the site for 8 hours. Granted, these are daylight hours, and it's only been viewed by 35 people. Indeed, all of these questions have low view counts, mainly in the 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having these kinds of questions on the site for extended periods &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; closing them is a broken windows problem. It gives the appearance that these questions are accepted. If that's what we actually want to say, well, that's a matter that we should take up as a community.

That's not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing that would be indicative of the latter is a large number of &quot;newbie&quot;-style questions.

I'm not saying there is nothing wrong with out community. It is a fact that our experts are very few, and they don't check the site regularly either. So you can see there is almost all the question have only one answer and that one answer is accepted. people check the site and start from the top checking all the questions, if they have at least one answer they usually skip that question even if that answer was not accepted, since they assume that answer was given by another expert and it's not accepted yet but going to be accepted. At least that's my opinion about this site. And there is one more thing, lots of people who know something doesn't have a question, and lots of people who have a question doesn't know anything at all! just look at people asking last 50 questions, there are only 6 people with reputation more than 200, And only 3 of them are above 500.

So instead of covering questions that actually distinguish GD from other SE sites, we end up being a somewhat specialized sub-site of SO, with mostly programming related questions. For example, I couldn't find a single question about a specific story or story element, a specific character, or a specific task or obstacle that a player faces in a game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of questions that I would like to ask and answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;How could I change this mechanic X to make it a better fit with my general theme, which is Y?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;What could be a twist for the hero's call in my particular hero's journey-like story that involves the notion of death?

Any ideas?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I felt discouraged from asking these questions both by the FAQ and by not seeing any similar questions on the site. Just to be sure, I asked in the chat whether or not these questions would be welcome on GDSE, and the reaction was that they would most likely be closed, and that they should rather be discussed on gamedev.net or some other discussion-based platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this actually common sense among GDSE users? Would you vote for closing any of these example questions? Or do you think that we should be more lax when it comes to SE's question/answer format to see more game design questions like these?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion is that all of these questions can be &quot;practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face&quot; (FAQ). True, there is not just one answer for any of these questions, so the pros and cons of any given answer might be debatable. Some questions are also open-ended in the sense that there is no limit to the number of suggestions that people can make. They can even have a tendency to be chatty in the sense that each suggestion can lead to further comments, edits in other answers, or even new answers. Despite these tendencies and slight deviations from a strict question/answer format, I would definitely opt for allowing these questions. They fit in SE's core template of questions, answers, and upvoting interesting questions and helpful answers. And, more importantly, it would make GDSE a much more useful website for game developers in general, and especially for game developers who are not also (or only) programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: Nicol Bolas and Tetrad pointed out that game design questions like the ones I mentioned need to provide sufficient context and specific guidelines as described in this community wiki entry on Writers.SE's meta site: &lt;a href=&quot;https://writers.meta.stackexchange.com/a/167&quot;&gt;https://writers.meta.stackexchange.com/a/167&lt;/a&gt;. I updated my example questions to indicate how context and guidelines could be provided in these cases. The answer is linked in Writers.SE's FAQ.

For example, take, &quot;&lt;em&gt;How could I make this enemy more engaging?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might be a reasonable question, assuming that &quot;this enemy&quot; and &quot;more engaging&quot; are suitably well defined.

Not without knowing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more about the game itself.

While my statement in bold &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a statement, it's a attitudinal statement (it says &quot;I believe...&quot;). Adding a comment for a down vote &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as close to a rule as anything else is in the FAQ. It says to add comments saying what's wrong, I don't know how it can get clearer than that. Just because it's not enforced automatically through the system does not make it less of a rule.

Since the down vote text says &quot;This answer is not useful&quot;, those are typically the answers I reserve the down vote for. If an answer is simply not as good as another answer, I just don't vote on it at all. Though If I were to down vote, since the FAQ asks me to comment, I do.

We normally want that. But in some of these cases, it's useful to have some semblance of a wiki that accrues more information about the topic over time. Yes, SE is not a wiki site, and there's GPWiki and others for that, but I'm frustrated by the by how milk-toast the information on those sites are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes SE great is the fact that (even if an answer is marked commuinty wiki) a single individual &quot;owns&quot; an answer. What they write in that answer is based on their experience and what has worked for them given their circumstances (hopefully aligning with the OP's circumstances, but still useful for future readers nonetheless). Valuable perspectives are things that are often out of reach for most wiki-like sites. There can often a little bit of opinion mixed up in a GDSE answer, and that's a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize this can set a dangerous trend for allowing &quot;getting started&quot; questions to flood the site (not to suggest they aren't here already though :P).

It is a triva question. You do not need any game development knowledge to answer it. You only need to have a specific military background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I happen to know the answer, nowadays missiles use a variety of technologies, an “imaging infrared&quot; seeker that can “see” the enemy aircraft (think computer vision). They can distinguish between a heat source like a decoy (flare) and a real enemy aircraft. They have wide detection angles so you do not even need to be directly in front of the enemy craft when firing. All it takes is looking at your target through your HMS and then pressing the button.

Why? Because it's &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; opinion based. Here's what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I'm making Mario Kart, collisions affecting car performance is a &lt;em&gt;really bad thing&lt;/em&gt;. However, if I'm making Gran Turismo, collisions affecting performance is a &lt;em&gt;really good thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But your question doesn't state what &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of racing game. It makes the incredibly ridiculous assumption that there is one correct answer for every possible racing game. There are a multitude of different styles of racing game. What is appropriate for your game depends &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; on what you're trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, it's not &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; enough. What you're asking is for people to say which gameplay they like better. &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; they'll explain why, and maybe they won't. But ultimately, you're not going to convince anyone to change their mind on their preferences, and in the end, the answers will help &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I'm looking to make a Mario Kart-style racing game, you're not going to find an argument that will convince me that it's a good idea to include collision damage. And if I'm making Gran Turismo, you won't convince me to take collision damage out of the game. Thus, nobody comes away with any actual wisdom or knowledge, and it was all just one big waste of everyone's time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Game design questions should not be so theoretical. They should be about practical design problems: &quot;I have a game that works like this. Players of that game seem to be doing X. I want them to be doing Y. How do I make that happen?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Game design is about problem solving. How do you make each element of the game fun and interesting in the way you want it to be. GameDev.SE is not about high-level conceptual questions. Design questions should be about the nitty-gritty of actually designing a game from front to back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the problem is that most hobbyist game developers will never get that far. And since they seem to be the majority on the site, we get a bunch of high-level garbage questions that never get enough close votes to die.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8240" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.100" LastActivityDate="2012-10-08T07:46:26.193" CommentCount="7" />

Just ensure that the code doesn't do things besides answer the question.

So in this case, your answer could have been several code blocks, each one handling a different platform, and then an example of checking the current platform. Together it would be all the code you pasted anyway, but it's probably a more helpful answer since it walks them through step-by-step instead of just throwing a bunch of code at them and relying on them to either figure it out or just copy-paste it into their code without any thought as to how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Example answer for inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is code to check the time in Windows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[some code]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's how to do it in Mac:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[some code]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here's how to check the platform:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[some code]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I implemented that in a single method that I called getCurrentTime(), and then I implemented a Timer class which used that method to track differences in time, ......&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I pasted the full source of my Timer class in this pastebin.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1593274092&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sketch comic book intro&lt;/a&gt; would certainly go over well, though perhaps a bit on the young side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think either or both (and probably the few more I'll hear about after posting this) would engender more than a few hours of delight, entertainment, and learning.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool game development related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;scripts packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;project or blogs from notable or just community devs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Would it make sense to implement a feature where you can gift a user the gap amount of reputation needed to chat? Gifting would involve the gifting user permanently giving enough of their own reputation to the user they would like to join chat. To lessen the blow, perhaps the receiving user needs to accept the gift of reputation and join the chat so that reputation doesn't just disappear (this isn't a requirement but I think it would make people more willing to use the feature as there would be less risk involved). It could also be a privilege that is unlocked at a certain reputation level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When would this get used?&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes there are bad questions for the site that would be enjoyable to discuss with the person looking for information and beneficial just to share opinions and experiences on the topic in real time. Often times, though, the user doesn't have enough rep to chat.

In short it was pointless even viewing them; so, I gave up and just started to use SE. After getting used to SE a while I spotted GDSE and used that for my fix as I enjoy simply browsing the sensible questions and answers as there are clearly some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clever people on GDSE, sadly there aren't as many quality questions as I would hope that could demonstrate just how many people of such calibre there are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've observed (either for wrong or right) that the signal to noise ratio for GDSE appears a little more skewed than the other SE sites. It appears that the 'noise' type questions tend to be ones that are too localised to be any good to anyone other than the asker, or questions that would require an epic novel to answer! I don't like to categorise people, but I would imagine that most (not all) of the closed questions were asked by people who had minimal experience of general development, were quite young and immature and were hoping for a quick solution for their new super game. Similarly, I wouldn't be suprised if the number of people who are capable of putting a well formed and meaningful question together are about the same number of people who can answer such a question as gamedev is a little more specific than a C/C++ question on SE. Unfortunately, the number of people who care little about asking (or rather caring about) the quality of a question is much higher than the other two groups!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with what you say - in fact I came to meta.gamedev.SE now to ask something very similar and found your question! Saying that, there is nothing wrong with a new user being completely ignorant on a subject, however they either fall into the category of wanting to learn about the subject or will just come back tomorrow with question number 2. Distinguishing between the two is simple, the question and the way it is written gives it away - handling it... well that's a different matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would hope that GDSE &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a little more exclusive, but a big issue is that people are quite happy to put quite a bit of effort into answering what is essentially be a terrible question, only for it to be accepted, then later down the line closed; I'm assuming so they get a few points. Granted, that's their business to waste their time with somebody who doesn't appreciate it but such actions can only encourage the asker that abysmal questions are tolerated - closing or even deleting the question after any sort of answer has been posted is well... the words horse, door and bolted come to mind!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the upvoting of useless questions, I would probably say it is nothing more than a result of people upvoting questions which are the sort of questions they would ask. It speaks volumes of the general crowd GDSE is attracting (although to be fair, it seems that game dev in general attacts such people looking for an &quot;easy win&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be very nice to stop such questions from appearing to begin with. The thing is, if somebody comes to GDSE and knows nothing about general development, or any other disciplines of game development, then they are hardly likely to ask questions/give answers that could be classed as gems. Obviously, it's not possible to test somebodys knowledge on game development (that kind of defeats the purpose of having a GDSE!), but game dev isn't isolated from other disciplines, so I don't know if there are any reasonable methods, but perhaps one (granted, it may be a little far fetched) is to ask for a minimum reputation on a relevant SE site before questions can be asked. It's trivial to get say for example 150 points on SE even just by asking some sensible questions, I imagine that would be enough of a barrier to stop these half-baked questions as effort is required which is exactly what most people who ask these sort of questions aren't prepared to give.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this isn't exactly perfect, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/q/27012/22887&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; by philllies.

Of all of the successful sites in the SE network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SO exists because forums were a terrible way to deal with questions. And one of the reasons for that is exactly this: every post is equally valid. There's no way to stop the flow of crap.

This is the forum life-cycle, and it is something SO was designed to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for all of SO's great technology, what fundamentally makes SO work is the zero tolerance the SO community has for garbage. On SO, it began with its founders and the initial beta users. That culture spread among the initial crop of public users. And now, the SO community, moderators, and founders alike will tolerate no compromises on their principles. And without that, SO would be a cesspool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is what GDSE is becoming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The culture of SO was very clear, as laid down by its founders.

This question would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; have been asked on Meta Stack Overflow. Instead, it's inverse question is usually asked: why don't we allow more poll questions? Why don't we allow more of these questions? Why was my question closed in 5 minutes? And so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in most cases, MSO users will quickly downvote and expurgate such questions. The community has said in a clear and convincing voice that there will be no retreat, no surrender, no compromise on its core principles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That GDSE's community can't/won't do the same is a damning indictment of GDSE as a whole. It shows that we don't have enough high-rep users who follow the SO principles. It shows that our culture is damaged, cancerous, riven with those who do not stand for what makes SO great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators are supposed to be the last line of defense. They're supposed to do what the community can't, act as a failsafe when the community can't achieve the goal alone. They should be the janitors, taking out the trash. But because they see the community as &quot;divided&quot; on the issue, they sit on the sidelines and let the crap build and grow. They see bad questions but won't use their moderator close votes to close them, simply because they don't feel there is a community consensus on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, it is the failure of democracy: one side gets its way by simply being obstinate. All it takes to keep this site down is for enough members of the community to say that &quot;garbage questions are fine.&quot; If enough of them do, then the moderators won't act, and our one fail-safe is sabotaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't really see a way out of this. So long as enough of the community clings to this forum mentality, where we believe that everyone should have a voice no matter how stupid, where we allow anyone to ask just about anything no matter how insipid, where you can get away with bad questions so long as someone comes along and blesses it with an undeservingly good answer, then GDSE will be a forum. A rathole of filth and garbage that few people would ever use as a viable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, to put it another way, the fact that some people disagree with the SO principles does not mean that they are right. It does not mean that their voices and opinions need to be appeased. And it does not mean that their opinions should be allowed to hold back moderators from doing their jobs and getting rid of what needs to be gotten rid of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either we take a hard line stand against garbage like most SE sites, or GDSE should stop pretending to be a Stack Exchange site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8240" LastActivityDate="2013-01-09T05:10:26.290" CommentCount="0" />

This accounts for the vast majority of my questions, and certainly have no merit in being asked here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermediate questions: Questions that arise whenever something doesn't work as I expect it to.

I probably should not even create those questions in the first time, and the lack of interest (upvotes) seem to agree with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tough questions: This is the stuff that really makes me think, and where I think I actually need help. However, this is usually too specific, and asking it will help nobody else, because nobody has my exact same problem. So I try to remove the details as much as I can, and end up with a question as generic as I can, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/45726/optimal-sprite-size-for-rotations&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/48151/what-are-the-rest-of-the-blending-functions-used-for&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/48096/how-do-i-prototype-an-online-game&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.

I disagreed with that person's answer, but I don't have a better one to supply. Not every good question has someone here that can answer it. Most people never have a use for anything other than the traditional blending mode and occasionally additive blending. You also have to accept that some people here on GD.SE can be quite brusque with their replies, and don't take it personally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) This question is too vague. You removed the extraneous text about your personal situation etc. but it was still too vague, because there are many of different types of online game and many aspects you could want to prototype. You've assumed there must be some sort of tool for your problem, but there isn't. There's just hard work and a lot of reading to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember this site is heavily focused on clearly answerable questions. Not every question is clearly answerable, and that doesn't make it a bad question, just one unsuitable for this site.

I just want to know what was good about it, so I can do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, my answer is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Too long&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not very helpful. The original question was tagged with &quot;libgdx&quot;, a library my answer doesn't mention even once (this is supported by the fact that the asker has not accepted the answer)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Based on lots of opinions and with no references.

As visible on the comments, there are lots of corner cases I'm not covering, and I know that most of the stuff I said is never that perfect in practice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unnecessary. What I said is much better covered at thousands of websites and books, with much better precision. A single &lt;a href=&quot;https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=difference%20between%20png%20gif%20jpg&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;google search&lt;/a&gt; shows much better answers than what I wrote.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not constructive. It's not technically an answer, and the knowledge I used to answer it is very shallow. I don't think I'm adding anything to the entire knowledge of the human race with this answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Poorly written. English is not my native language, and it clearly shows on my answer. There are so many grammar and composition errors even in its current shape that I would like to edit it again, but by doing so, the question would get bumped, which is something I'd rather avoid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet for some reason people seemed to like it, and now it's one of the highest voted answers in the entire site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I originally wrote the answer in frustration that none of the current answers were very accurate, so my answer was more of a rant against the other answers, than an honest answer to the originally very poor question which I actually downvoted. The reasons for writing that answer were not good, and I think the answer itself was not good either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet for some reason, people seemed to like it. Why? I have no idea. I prefer answers in which my personal experiences add value to both the question and the answer, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/40855/ui-mockups-to-the-code/42204#42204&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/47009/is-there-a-sound-library-for-c-to-generate-sound-samples-from-code/47010#47010&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.

How did Call of Duty 2 implement Physics?&quot; and such. But that problem comes with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; question asker who thinks their particular problem is special. The community standard is that the effect Y in game X should be unique enough to be exclusively associated with game X as a GDSE question. Everyone who asks, answers, or reviews one of these questions should have an obligation to search for preexisting questions that already provide an answer out of the context of the game, closing the question if it is asked and is found to be redundant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But proprietary knowledge, breaking contracts!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who gives a shit?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't answer if you can't legally do so.

And if you're experimenting on a weird platform, nobody's going to have a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; answer for you, so it's much more useful to ask about older games that were on older platforms with similar but different peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3656" LastActivityDate="2013-02-27T23:40:35.313" CommentCount="3" />

The asker provides a big block of code to sift through, including reading keyboard input and etc.  On the plus side, the question provides a clear explanation of exactly what is going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a huge fan of big code-dumps, personally.  But this one at least is reasonably well formatted and it's easy to skip past the obviously irrelevant bits.  I guess my concern is that fundamentally, this is a &quot;find the math bug in my code&quot; question, rather than one which addresses a concept which can be explained or a technique which can be learned.  See my comments re: discoverability of &quot;solutions to a math bug&quot; questions under the &quot;arcball&quot; question, below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has an accepted answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/54579/creating-arcball-in-cocos-3d&quot;&gt;creating arcball in cocos 3d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is another &quot;help me my code isn't working and I don't know why&quot; post.  Which probably isn't tremendously surprising as it involves quaternion math, which isn't a trivial thing for anybody.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question is a huge code dump, and includes a download link to get even more code.  If this had focused down on &quot;what is the right way to do quaternion math&quot;, then I think it could have been a really good and useful question (if there isn't already such a question), but as is, I have trouble mustering enthusiasm to go delving through somebody else's math code just to go searching for an arithmetic bug.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not certain how finding this guy's maths bug and indexing the particular located bug in Google helps the Internet as a whole;  the next guy will presumably have a different maths bug, and we'll just wind up answering this same question again and again, just with different swapped variables or subtracts that should have been adds in each new asker's version of the code.  So I'm inclined to agree with the &quot;too localized&quot; evaluation.  Again, my view is that this isn't somebody asking for something to be explained, or to be taught;  he's just asking us to find his maths error for him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe that view is a personal failing of mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/55220/2d-array-bounds&quot;&gt;2d array bounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have trouble parsing the question, here.  It appears to be another plea for someone to debug their code for them.  Whatever the question actually is, even if someone was motivated to go delving through source code to find the bug, the question is fundamentally unanswerable, because not enough code is provided.  My instinct is that this question, if pursued, would have turned into a &quot;teach me how to program&quot; question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn't have voted &quot;too localized&quot; on this question.  I'd have voted &quot;not a real question&quot;, myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/55175/opengl-noob-using-vbo-to-draw-a-colored-triangle&quot;&gt;OpenGL noob: Using VBO to draw a colored triangle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one doesn't look terrible to me.  At least the problem is well-defined, and the source code has been trimmed down to a somewhat reasonable amount for people to peruse.  Fundamentally, it's still a &quot;I haven't checked for existing learning resources&quot; sort of question, but I think this one could have been salvaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real question from my point of view is whether someone else would ever have found it -- the asker's misunderstanding was regarding the precise usage of glBindBuffer(), which is fair enough.  But none of that shows up in the question text -- there's no way for another user to find it.  Once the real solution was found, I wouldn't have been against someone editing the question to really tighten it up to fit the actual problem, to aid in discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this one was closed due to its very low prose:code ratio, which is usually a strong indicator of questions which are only of use to one person at one moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has an accepted answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/55175/opengl-noob-using-vbo-to-draw-a-colored-triangle&quot;&gt;Random AI movement on tiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm having trouble understanding this question.  I'd have asked the poster to rephrase in an edit, and voted &quot;Not a real question&quot; in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/55154/my-logic-in-collision-detection-in-diagonal-code-correct&quot;&gt;My logic in collision detection in diagonal code correct?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one doesn't describe the problem and doesn't explain what needs to be fixed.  The question appears to be &quot;Is it necessary to have a diagonal collision for the wall?&quot;, which there's no way for us to know without a lot more context (what the game is, how big the wall is, where it is, how thick it is, how far game objects move in a frame, etc).  I think I'd have gone with &quot;Not a real question&quot; on this one as well;  I don't think the question is defined enough to be &quot;too localized&quot;.  (Although I can see an argument that if nobody else can understand the question, its answer is probably not going to be of much use to them, either.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;My conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just from my examination of the last 48 hours, I guess I'm not really seeing a problem.  Granted that there are some questions which I wouldn't myself have classed as &quot;Too Localized&quot;, but many of them I would have voted to close for other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was a little surprised that there were only these six &quot;too localized&quot; questions in the last two days -- I've had the same sense as the OP that there have been lots and lots of extremely localized questions being closed on the site, but that doesn't seem to be borne out by this data.  Having only six closed in two days surprises me a lot.  And further investigation suggests that this rate doesn't seem to be unusual -- there were only six closed for that reason in the previous two days, as well.  And even fewer in the two days before that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting that both of the questions which I considered to be potentially answerable did get answers, and the original poster of each accepted those answers, even though the questions were later closed as &quot;too localized&quot;.  So the whole &quot;too localized&quot; thing doesn't seem to actually be stopping people from providing personal assistance when the questions asked are truly answerable. (as per my admittedly subjective opinion re: answerability).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a wider analysis of more data would show a different trend, but just going on the basis of the data from the last 48 hours, I'm not seeing anything particularly alarming in regards to questions closed as &quot;too localized&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7728" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.557" LastActivityDate="2013-06-06T06:01:53.323" CommentCount="4" />

I just kept checking the page to see if an answer pops up. After a while, I got disappointed and left; 2 days later I came back to the question, and noticed that it was voted down 9 times, edited down to a point where the friendly tone of my question was removed (even though the question was crystal clear before the edition), and was closed as not constructive. Additionally, all the comments addressing the high-rep member as abusive were removed as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Now I understand the &quot;Not Constructive&quot; part (since my question was not really constructive), but the edition and the -9 vote downs makes me feel abused by high-rep members.

Second, in the recent past, there was a rash of sock-puppetry on GDSE. That's probably where the -25 came from. The sock puppet owner likely upvoted your question from 5 different accounts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/31443/darrenvortex?tab=reputation&quot;&gt;When those sock puppet accounts were removed, the votes were undone, hence the -25.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, your question was edited to remove the &quot;friendly tone&quot; because what you call &quot;friendly tone&quot; is just pointless noise. If you think your question is &quot;not the most 'constructive' question to be asked on a Q&amp;amp;A forum&quot;, then you &lt;em&gt;shouldn't be asking it&lt;/em&gt; to begin with.

These questions generally have many (but not necessarily all) of the following features:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A very poor text-to-code ratio, often with a huge code dump that one must scroll through to find the the relevant parts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Little in the way of indication that the person asking has tried anything themselves to resolve the problem; they may have hacked and slashed at the code a bit, but that would be the limit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Little in the way of any coherent description of what the problem actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; - often not much more than &quot;this doesn't work&quot;.  No indication of how it doesn't work, what the OP expects to happen, what actually happens.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Code that's poorly formatted, frequently inconsistently formatted, and appears to have been copy/pasted from several different sources (it's occasionally possible to actually track down some of those sources).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some fundamental misunderstandings about how what they're trying to do actually works.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &quot;just give me the code!&quot; attitude; I recall one from some years ago where the person asking literally said &quot;don't give me concepts, give me code!&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes an insistence on use of an inappropriate solution for or approach to the problem they're trying to solve (if that problem can be even determined from the question).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On they're own any one of these is probably salvagable from the &quot;too localized&quot; bin, and may even become a good question with heavy reworking, but when they come together it becomes difficult to see much hope.  The ultimate arbiter of whether or not such a question goes into &quot;too localized&quot; is therefore: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;is any possible answer going to be of any possible use to any possible person besides the person asking the question and in the very specific circumstances they are in now?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the only answer to that is &quot;no&quot; then it's &quot;too localized&quot; for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9134" LastActivityDate="2013-06-10T00:50:19.643" CommentCount="0" />

But I think that the reasons they don't have more to do with issues surrounding their own free time and the legal restrictions they are bound by. Any developer who has day-to-day issues concerning the Xbox One SDK won't be able to find help here because of the NDA they've signed (for example). Even developers on PC titles may worry about accidentally revealing things considered trade secrets by their employer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we can do more to increase the appeal of this site for more experienced developers (professional and otherwise), but I'm not convinced there's anything that could be done on our end to encourage more professionals to visit and participate &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with the functionality afforded to moderators to communicate directly with members. Presuming there is some mechanism by which I can talk directly, in private, to a troublesome user, I would start there. I'd review the flagged actions and ask the user to correct the undesirable behavior. If necessary, I'd interject in the actual comments/discussions to suppress flame-wars (but I don't believe that the first response should be to delete a comment thread without warning or without public record).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in the long run I believe there are more users willing to contribute value to the site than want to harm it. A user who was doing too much harm to the site, and was not responsive to civil suggestions to change that behavior, is not something we need to keep around, regardless of how useful their future answers might otherwise be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would raise the issue in the chat or, if possible, privately, and attempt to come to an understanding as to the other moderators reasoning. &quot;Revert wars&quot; (or their equivalent) among moderators are uncalled for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators keep their fingers on the pulse of the community and act in such a way to provide agency to that community. They try to understand where the community wants the site to go and then provide guidance and support towards achieving that goal. When there is debate, they act as objective mediators (or at least respect when their objectivity has been compromised and defer to another moderator's judgement). When there is undesirable behavior, they police the site and work to correct any issues in a fair and reasonable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

I also hope to be able to use my binding votes and other moderator powers (sparingly) to achieve a swifter resolution to &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; spam, troll, or otherwise unpleasant activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you want to make this site more friendly to newcomers and beginners?

I think the majority of the population at close-vote level does an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; job of explaining to users why they've posted a bad question and guiding them to ask better ones or to seek what answers they need elsewhere, if applicable. I would encourage more of that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How do you compare against the other candidates?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I differ primarily in the issues outlined in my nomination post: I'm one of the few professionals who actively contributes to the site, and I'm one of the highest-rated users here. Regardless, I don't believe the role of a moderator is to reflect his or her personal bias onto the site, but rather to gather an understanding of the community's view as a whole and act as agent for that view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Being a moderator will definitely take some of your time.

But proportionally, the time I spend answering is less than the time I spend reading, processing review queues, exploring meta, and generally surveying the site. I don't feel that taking on a moderation role would negative impact the way in which I answer questions here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Aren't you afraid that you will burn out solving mundane issues that you could ignore before?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a valid concern, and one that I considered before putting my name into the running. However, I ultimately decided that it would not be a problem since I've been moderating forums for years now without feeling that burn out. I expect it to be even less of an issue when there are many other skilled moderators on the team; we will be able to complement each other's occasional lapses in monitoring due to external pressures (like real-life concerns).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am fully prepared to step down should I ever be unable to fulfill the time commitment required of moderation duties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:43:58.067" LastActivityDate="2013-06-18T00:35:10.167" CommentCount="1" />

They bring up the questions that many of us take for granted. The answers given to these questions can even be informative to experienced users who just hadn't thought of other ways of doing things. I think the moderators task is to ensure these questions are within a reasonable scope and on topic. They do that by commenting, editing and closing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;2: How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that a user in that situation clearly finds value in the site, but is overzealous in their reactions. A conversation with a diamond moderator about the situation would be a great first step. If the behavior continued, and further conversations were fruitless. The next step is a temporary ban. Even if a user is contributing to the site, being hostile to other users doesn't support the kind of community we want here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;3: How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Talk with the other mod about it.

They both guide the community and are guided by the community. Keeping the site clean by closing or migrating blatantly off topic questions and responding to user flags. Since their votes are binding, moderators take more of a background role in closures. Only for the extreme cases do moderators act first. Moderators are judges in a community that primarily police themselves, they don't have to act often, but when necessary they act impartially and with conviction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;5: A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

Since I'm on the site regularly throughout the day I can be more effective with moderator powers because I can respond quickly to content that doesn't belong here. I don't have any epic plans for changing the site, I just want to continue to ensure it's welcoming and helpful to beginners and professionals. Having the powers of a moderator would make me more effective in that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;7: Do you want to make this site more friendly to newcomers and beginners?

There isn't much we can do to stop these questions being asked in the first place, but we can try to help those users by ensuring they know the resources available to them. Typically more research is the answer to these types of questions, and that's something the user will have to do on their own (we can't know what they know already, their style of learning or their end goal). A comment outlining the high level steps they should take and closing the question are sufficient in this situation. I'd make sure they know what kind of questions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on topic here, we want them to come back if they run into an issue that would generate a good question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;8: How do you compare against the other candidates?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My primary differences are how &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/7191/byte56?tab=activity&amp;amp;sort=all&quot;&gt;active I am on the site&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/7191/byte56?tab=answers&quot;&gt;passion for teaching&lt;/a&gt;.

Even though the title of the &quot;duplicate&quot; question doesn't really match the question in the one you're pointing out, if you read it the guy is asking for the same thing, namely &quot; I would like to release a partially complete, unpolished game on my website so people can try it out and give me feedback.&quot;  Which makes it a dupe in spirit at least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question doesn't pass the &quot;what have you tried&quot; smell test.  So I think it's also too broad. &quot;Give some link or example so that i can understand easily...&quot; just shows lack of research/understanding on the issues.

As I touched on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1001/gift-reputation-to-users-that-need-it-to-join-chat&quot;&gt;previous meta question&lt;/a&gt; (I really want to get people into the chat as you can tell) a lot of times these bad questions are from new users without the reputation to chat though. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I and a few other users were once again talking about this problem in the chat room we came up with the idea that user created chat rooms could be used for this purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal future scenario, you could keep the scope of a room to a single question and the room could be removed after a certain amount of inactivity so that it doesn't get too cluttered. In the ideal future, there would be a button on a question that you could click to create a chat room that would automatically grant the OP access to chat in the room and there would be a very obvious notification in his site inbox and on the question itself that the question has been promoted to chat, or something like that. I think a notification of a new chat room in the main site chat room would also be useful, much like the meta question notifications that show up nice and big right in the chat area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a more realistic, near future thinking world - this could be as simple as letting anyone join user created rooms. Someone with high enough reputation already has the ability to create chat rooms so there is a limit/barrier as to who can do this. This high rep user would create the room, probably as a gallery to prevent bots from coming in and spamming (I assume this is why there is a low rep barrier) and leave a comment on the soon to be closed question inviting the OP to chat with a link. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting these users into chat to talk out their (inappropriate for the site) game dev related questions and problems should result in the users having a better understanding as to why their question is inappropriate for the site, because I'm sure it would come up in the chat conversation, and get them coming back for help in the real chat when they have enough rep for off topic questions, and on the QA portion of the site for on topic questions which is an improvement in community as well as site question and answer quality... hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13052" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:43:58.067" LastActivityDate="2013-07-03T22:22:51.507" Title="Proposal to remove the reputation barrier on chatting in user created chat rooms" Tags="&lt;feature-request&gt;&lt;chat&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="12" />

If the original question contains information in it's answers that also answers the new question, then - IMO - it's a clear case of &quot;close as duplicate&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point I'm making here is that if question A was &quot;what's 2+2?&quot; and question B was &quot;what's 2+3?&quot;, yes they are different questions which do have different answers, but if question A was answered in a way that explained how addition worked, then question B is clearly a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This all depends on perspective.  For me, &lt;strong&gt;close as duplicate is not a slap-down&lt;/strong&gt; and it's not harsh moderation.  It's actually something very different to those - it's actually a &lt;strong&gt;valid way of providing an answer to a question&lt;/strong&gt;.

A list of suggestions for game developers to avoid is &lt;em&gt;not searchable&lt;/em&gt;; it's just a random list of stuff. If someone found this question, it would only be by actually searching for &quot;things not to do&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And people don't search for that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not even a &lt;em&gt;comprehensive&lt;/em&gt; list, so if you're looking for things not to do, you haven't actually found it.

While people could post their personal experiences with things they've done or seen done, people are more likely to just come up with stuff off the top of their heads. And the stuff will have no rhyme or reason to it: some will be game design, some will be programing, some will be art, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How to prevent the &quot;Too awesome to use&quot; syndrome?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this question opinion-based? To a degree, yes. But the question is very clear and specific about what it's talking about trying to prevent. This invites people to provide theories of why this syndrome happens and therefore how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People are being invited to provide opinions on how to solve the problem. But that's not very different than people posting opinions about how to fix a particular program. People have different ways of solving the same problem. The thing that makes this question good is that the &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; itself is reasonably stated and meaningfully scoped.

Interaction between participants on the chatroom is also allowed and recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How we see this gamejam working:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Before the jam starts, an announcement (question, or answer to this&#xA;very question?) is posted on meta.gd with extra instructions;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As the jam progresses, participants answer the above mentioned&#xA;question, by providing a link to their game and sources;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the jam ends, the question gets locked;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Participants play others' games and vote on answers (games);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The game (answer) with the most votes, wins;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the voting has ended, all of the games are uploaded to a public&#xA;GitHub repo. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the GameJam's goal is to hone one's skills and bring developers together on our community, no actual prizes were thought of. If, however, the SE team decides to award promotional merchandise such as t-shirts or mugs to the winners, we'll gladly be okay with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've not decided what to call this GameJam. So far our options lie within the list: { Seasonal GDSE GameJam, GDSE Challenge, GDGJ (GameDev GameJam) }. Opinions and ideas are welcome, so please share them here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user15805" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditorDisplayName="user15805" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:43:58.067" LastActivityDate="2013-10-26T18:51:43.277" Title="GameJam Proposal" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="11" FavoriteCount="13" />

Unfortunately almost all of them are closed being off-topic. I think there's a problem here, since this is clearly a legitimate question and most new people don't really know where to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a suggestion that new signed up users are asked what level of experience and the reason he/she is coming to stackexchange, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beginner (programming and gamedev)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beginner ( only in gamedev ) but knows how to program.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Intermedia in game dev and programming.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Expert&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then depending on his skill level he/she will be guided for existing resources.

It is extremely difficult, in practice, to accurate define a set of skill level tiers that can reasonably cover the gamut of all users. Your example tiers are woefully underspecified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, people are mostly &lt;a href=&quot;http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/unskilled.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;unskilled and unaware of it&lt;/a&gt;, and will tend to misdiagnose their own level of competence in a domain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you have the problem of appropriately cataloguing your suggested &quot;tier-appropriate resources&quot; -- under what criteria is something considered a &quot;good&quot; resource for a beginner-level user? Especially considering that vast majority of users seem to fall into the less-experienced tier, community voting on the content is not likely to be a reasonable approach. And also, who is going to curate the content for &quot;expert&quot; users?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, there's the usability problem. As ToddersLegrande points out, users are already ignoring the help center links, information that is designed to guide them right from the start. You could argue that the link is too out-of-the-way, and that by forcing a modal UX in front of them when they first sign up, you'd solve that problem. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2008/10/31/nobody-reads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;users don't read dialog boxes&lt;/a&gt; (plus, when you are new or unregistered, the sites already display fairly large banner prompts directing you to information about what the site is about).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's not what this site is about.

Basically impossible.  This option would give the projectiles the ability to &quot;home-in&quot; on the enemy planets, which would greatly help the game on its way to becomming winnable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Collision detection - This would seem to have been essential to the game, but because collisions are extremely rare, the chances of hitting a planet were only &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; decreased by not having any such check.  Much like not buying powerball tickets.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Survivability - the chance for an impact to only partially destroy an enemy, allowing them to continue fighting.  For example, by diminishing their population.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Strategic zoom - the ability to zoom in on an arbitary area.  This would be useful to follow a planet or view a launch or hit.

Once logged in, click &lt;a href=&quot;http://likeclockworkgame.appspot.com/Create&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Create a Bot!&lt;/a&gt; from the bot list. Enter a name and description for the bot, you will not be able to publish with both of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drag and connect blocks from the sidebar inside the Blockly window to make a script. All blocks must be connected. The entire code block is wrapped in a &lt;code&gt;while(true)&lt;/code&gt;, so you do not need to manually create a forever loop. Here's a quick look at what you can do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving costs 10 'ticks'. You can move forward or backward. If you bump into a wall, the &lt;code&gt;Bumped&lt;/code&gt; flag will be true, but you will still lose your 10 ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turning left and right consumes 10 ticks, and turns your character left or right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;Facing&lt;/code&gt; to tell which direction you are facing. Compare this to direction block, or just use the &lt;code&gt;Is Facing&lt;/code&gt; block if you prefer. No ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All scans use 3 ticks and populate the &lt;code&gt;Last Scan Result&lt;/code&gt; block that you can compare to the &lt;code&gt;Scan Type&lt;/code&gt; block to see what you've scanned (Nothing, Wall, Bot, or Arrow). Scanning left or right will only scan 10 tiles, while scanning forward will scan until it hits something. (There's also a perimeter scan that I forgot to include)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attacking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your bots are archers with a limited quiver of 30 arrows. Shooting an arrow will cost you 10 ticks, and 1 arrow. Arrows travel at one tile per click, so it is (barely) possible to scan one and jump out of the way if you're not facing it. Arrows kill instantly (I may change this later).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're desperate, you can also &lt;code&gt;stab&lt;/code&gt; your opponent, which kills any bot in the space directly in front of you. This will only cost you 5 ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving/Loading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pressing &quot;Save&quot; will give you a URL that you can keep a record of, or share, but it will not make the bot available for fights. In order to fight, you must publish your bot. Currently, there is no way to load a bot, BUT you can either use that Save URL, or let Blockly remember the last bot you were working on. It will automatically load your last working environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can save over your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; old bots if you provide the exact same name.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool game development related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;scripts packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;project or blogs from notable or just community devs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

This is clearly a graphics programming question and not gamedev.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You know not everything about graphics programming (like scientific visualization), geometry or image processing is game development related, even if they have many common things such as intersection testing or acceleration data structure this doesn't mean that the question is game development or game engine related (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/67613/how-can-i-rotate-a-bitmap-without-d3d-or-opengl&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/43745/ray-tracing-concers-efficient-data-structure-and-photon-mapping&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and many others). For example if I have a question about Path Tracing is this considered on topic? According to our current help center and site polcy it is not (or it should not be as it's not explicitly declared) but people here are just accepting it and answering it  ( and probably most my answers are graphics programming).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, I still think that those questions can be reasonably answered here, and should be explicitly considered on topic. So my suggestion is somehow &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, GDSE in its current form should also include image processing and graphics programming questions, so people are encouraged to ask those questions here instead of other sites like SO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the question is what would we gain from this site becoming gamedev and graphics programming:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People interested in graphics programming, image processing and not&#xA;only game dev may/will come here eventually. Hopefully this will enhance the quality&#xA;of the questions and the site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Graphics programming questions will finally have a proper place to be asked. So instead of questions spanning multiple SE sites. This will be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; proper place to ask them, so they should be migrated here whenever they show up on other sites. I even have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19183647/3d-volume-rendering-and-multiple-point-of-view-occlusion&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; I answered on SO a while a ago.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Game development is a very loosely defined term. Explicitly defining graphics programming that are not only related to games ( and probably image processing) will bring us better quality questions, and consequently enrich the website's knowledge base.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/61961/graphics-layer-architecture&quot;&gt;proposal on Area51 for graphics programming&lt;/a&gt;, I think that this should be merged here instead.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, my suggestion is to declare this site as gamedev and graphics programming (and probably rename it!). I would like to hear how is this possible? And your opinions on the subject, to be honest I find it very logical, but probably most of you wont agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5440" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:37:42.347" LastActivityDate="2013-12-29T13:40:30.537" Title="Should we better define the scope of GDSE to include graphics programming and image processing questions?"

Pixel density (or probably more accurately described as &quot;texel density&quot;) on a modern iPhone game vs. a PC game can be quite varied.

Indoor games vs outdoor games can also matter.

Industry trivia isn't something we have generally considered on-topic here (there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/831/are-why-did-game-x-do-y-questions-not-constructive&quot;&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt; related &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1063/why-should-how-was-the-technique-in-x-done-be-considered-off-topic&quot;&gt;meta discussions&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/626/is-how-was-entire-game-x-made-off-topic&quot;&gt;touch on the topic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe there's a good question here, and I presume you do want this knowledge for some project of yours, but we have to work with the questions as they are written, there's only so much jumping-to-conclusions that we can reasonably do without running too much of a risk of misinterpreting the asker and providing misleading answers. (if you really do just want to have a discussion about it, that's also great, but this isn't the site for it; there's a list of good places to have such a discussion in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/help&quot;&gt;Help Center&lt;/a&gt;, including our own &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/19/game-development&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;). I think a better way to phrase that question would be along the lines of asking for a good texel density measure to achieve a certain level of visual fidelity on a certain platform under certain normal gameplay conditions, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address some of your other questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I see some questions around SE that have answers the size of 2 pages,&#xA;  would those be to broad?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe; probably. The number of answers a question could have is less of an indicator than the size of any single potential answer is. Further, just because &quot;other SE&quot; sites permit a certain level of broadness doesn't mean this one does. Finally, just because you can find a similar example of a question that did remain open doesn't make a case for either side: it's possible the other question was just missed, for example, or (as in the case of that LOD question, it could be that the question was asked before a current policy was enacted; the LOD question is from 2010). It's also possible I'm wrong, in which case the community can overturn my voting decision or discuss the issue here on meta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Also, why can just one guy close my question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a privilege I have as an elected site moderator.

However, your ideas (they weren't very clear) for solving them don't address those problems.  In my opinion, your ideas for solving them represent lingering problems on SO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a person posts on SO &quot;How do I do X in javascript&quot;, and they receive a slew of answers complete with 4-part jsfiddles, that's...dubious.  Yes, they got help, and yes, the multiple solutions can be helpful to people.  But it sets an unfortunate tone for the site.  People expect to be able to do no research on their own, simply post their problem, and receive a complete tutorial instantly.  That isn't really the spirit of the SO; it's something of an emergent behavior.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's ok for javascript.  There's usually a quick solution that is based on utilizing some feature of the DOM or HTML5 or CSS, and the questioner simply didn't know what they didn't know.  They couldn't really google a term to research, and they didn't want to read the full spec, so they expressed it the best they could, as a raw how-to question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Game development questions (and frequently, a lot of SO questions as well) cannot be answered like that.  You can't post &quot;how do I make an MMO&quot; and get an answer.  There is no right answer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no equivalent to jsfiddle for game development.  When people post those questions here, they expect someone to tell them the right answer so that they can avoid studying and building their knowledge the hard way.  That is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GameDev.SE can answer (some) game design questions.  It can sometimes list graphical techniques.  It can flesh out algorithm implementations.

The problems they have are rather different, though, and some of them may be fixable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/71550/how-can-i-do-infinite-ground-for-running-game&quot;&gt;first question&lt;/a&gt; was closed as &quot;too broad&quot;, but IMO, a more accurate closing reason would've been &quot;unclear what you're asking&quot;.  Basically, condensing the question and its answers and comments into a few lines, they essentially went like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;I want to make a running game with infinite ground.  How could I do that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A: &quot;One way is to split the world into several parts, and keep creating new parts in front of the player and removing old ones behind them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;C: &quot;I tried that, but the player falls through the floor!  Why does that happen?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, it's a kind of a &lt;a href=&quot;//meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/43478/exit-strategies-for-chameleon-questions&quot;&gt;chameleon question&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; it started out as a conceptual question about maintaining the illusion of an infinite world, and then morphed halfway through into a &quot;there's a bug in my code&quot; question (with no actual code included, which makes finding the bug extra difficult).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions like these cannot really be meaningfully answered, since the actual question being asked is a broad, nebulous and moving target.  To try to give a useful answer, one would have to &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; which level of abstraction, from general game mechanics to specific coding syntax, the OP is actually having problems with &amp;mdash; and it may well turn out that the answer is &quot;all of them&quot;, in which case the question is indeed too broad for Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The general way to fix such questions, where possible, is to engage in comment dialogue with the asker to try and clarify what they already know and what they're specifically having trouble with, and then edit the question to focus on that one, specific, answerable issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it may also be possible to split such questions into multiple parts, one for each of the component problems.  For example, this example question is broad enough that it could be split into (at least) three distinct questions with distinct levels of abstraction:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can I create the illusion of infinite ground in a running game?&quot; (abstract, platform-independent),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How to implement infinite ground in AndEngine?&quot; (concrete, platform-specific), and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why does the player fall through my infinite terrain?&quot; (very specific; should include a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve&quot;&gt;minimal example&lt;/a&gt; for testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/71554/basic-workflows-for-game-development-udk-cryengine-unity-export-format&quot;&gt;second example question&lt;/a&gt;, the main problem is simply that it's phrased as asking for the &quot;best&quot; way to do something, even though, underneath, it's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a &quot;how to&quot; question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To see the difference, compare these two hypothetical &lt;a href=&quot;//cooking.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad question&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;What's the best way to cook an egg?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will invite a countless list of subjective answers, with one answered preferring their eggs hard-boiled, while another one likes theirs fried sunny-side up.  (Cue lengthy comment debate on the relative merits of sunny-side up vs. over easy.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good question&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;How do I cook an egg?  I tried putting it in the microwave, but it exploded!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good question&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;How do I cook an egg?  I know I can just boil it for ten minutes, but I never get a nice runny yolk that way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These questions clearly specify what the asker wants, and how far they've got on their own (i.e. in development terms, which level of abstraction they're interested in / having problems with).  While the &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt; is still very broad, it's clear that the specific question &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be adequately answered in a reasonable space &amp;mdash; at a bare minimum, &quot;immerse the eggs in boiling water for three minutes&quot; is technically an adequate answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one thing these good questions &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; do is ask for the single &quot;best&quot; way to do something.  Somewhat paradoxically, by not doing so, they actually encourage comprehensive answers that describe &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; good solutions and compare their respective advantages &amp;mdash; like, say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There are many ways to cook eggs, but, as you've noticed, microwaving is generally not one of them (although &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/arielknutson/easy-ways-to-cooks-eggs-in-a-microwave&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be done&lt;/a&gt;).  One of the simplest ways is to immerse the eggs in boiling water for a short time; depending on the immersion time, this can produce either a fully congealed (&quot;hard-boiled&quot;) or a partially runny egg. [...] Eggs can also be fried on a hot pan.  Again, there are several ways to do this: [...] Other methods of preparing eggs include shirring, poaching, scrambling, etc. [...] Eggs can also be used as an ingredient in many dishes, such as...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum:&lt;/strong&gt; Prompted by your comments, I tried to see if I could edit your question into something that I would personally find useful and answerable.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/revisions/71554/3&quot;&gt;Here's what I ended up with.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, while doing so, I ended up repeatedly running against the fundamental issue that your question doesn't seem to include &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&quot;&gt;&quot;a practical, answerable question based on an actual problem that you face&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

For instance questions that ask how to get something specific done (in code perhaps) are fine because you can run the answer in an interpreter (or compile it) and see if it works. Other questions where the opinions can be strongly based up by fact, work too. The facts are the meter where the compiler was the meter in the former. This is why we don't call them opinion based questions. On the other hand there are questions based where answers will nearly entirely be based on taste, personality and other factors, such as which computer should I program my games on? Which language is better for games? Which engine should I use? This are not helpful because the user is not in &lt;code&gt;Point A&lt;/code&gt;, she is not stuck with a problem she can't resolve. She often did not even get actually started. The magical path to greatness is not something we oft can provide in a two paragraph answer to a person we haven't met in a way that any reader would gain something useful by reading it also. Therefore it does fit in a Q&amp;amp;A. It fits in a laid back discussion forum.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about a specific game mechanic or how to make something are also fine as long as that something can be reasonably explained in an answer that fits into a screen (pictures don't count).

If you drop out of the bidding, you lose half of your investment. If you win the bid, your entire bid is paid for the privilege of selecting the most worthy combatant first. Any money you do not spend in the first round carries over to the second round! So you don't have to spend everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the second round of the game, there are 6 types of tournaments that will be held, each testing your gladiators in different ways. Be sure to check the heading for the competition type (eg: Polearms: Str + Int). Each player selects a combatant, and then the best combatant takes the largest prize, second best takes the second largest prize, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most money at the end wins!

Memorize (or look at the source) the best soldiers to recognize them when they appear. Note that there is no &quot;best&quot; solider, only soldiers that are most suited to a task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The six tournaments are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand to Hand:&lt;/strong&gt; Str * Dex&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Quarters&lt;/strong&gt; Str * Int&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chariots&lt;/strong&gt; Dex * Int&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranged&lt;/strong&gt; Str + Dex&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polearms&lt;/strong&gt; Str + Int&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horseback&lt;/strong&gt; Dex + Int&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to have a well-rounded troop in order to win each category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 30 prizes are numbered 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.

After 3 months of development (in a 5 month timespan, because school and work get in the way) the engine is functional in a bare bones kind of way. So before I go any farther I've decided to make a few small games like Solitaire and Minesweeper, just to make sure my design is on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/oX7lP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nIce Suite main menu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not very far in development yet, but since the engine is ECS based, and scripts are just a component that can be added to anything, it makes it real easy to add fancy transition effects.

I explained so in comments there after voting to reopen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My understanding of the spirit of the &quot;which tech&quot; close reason is that it can't be answered in the general case; it can only be answered on a per-project basis.  The specific requirements of a given game, as well as design decisions, will dictate what is best to use.  So there is no singular correct answer.  Anything that attempts to give a general answer would need to answer innumerable questions simultaneously, for all the possible different scenarios.  For reasons of limited space, any answer which attempts to do that would only give several weak answers to a handful of considerations.  That is no good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean that specific problems can't be solved by the judicious application of the right library.  For some problems, picking the right tool is the best answer.  The trick is to start with the problem, and then define what constitutes a solution, and then locate it.  If that solution happens to be &quot;use library X&quot; (with justification), that's a good answer.  And specific questions that have good answers should be on-tpoic, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I think this question is an instance of the second case.

Other operating systems may work, but don't count on it.

It uses the Pygame library for graphics and other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tarbeyon is heavily inspired by Terraria and similar games, but is not currently planned to be a sandbox game, although that may change later. It is in a very early stage, mainly because I had to constantly deal with performance issues, so I do not have much time to create new features. Also, Tarbeyon is only an occasional project, and my other game takes priority over it, usually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Warning...... all art is placeholder and a bit messy!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4fv1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gameplay Screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Downloads:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to try Tarbeyon, you can find it and the (Windows) dependencies here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/flaminghatgames/tarbeyon/downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://bitbucket.org/flaminghatgames/tarbeyon/downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dependencies for other platforms should be fairly easy to find (&lt;a href=&quot;http://python.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Official Python website&quot;&gt;Python here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Pygame Bitbucket Repository&quot;&gt;Pygame here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To run, first install the dependencies, then unzip the zip file.

After obtaining an answer I thought I'd go on and research some literature about the indices I'd obtain. Of course, an over-zealous moderator reacted to a flag by a user, who is perfectly content with orthographic and linear perspective projections. I've edited the question and flagged the moderator as per stackoverflow &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/help/reopen-questions&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;.

Full stop. It's asking for a list of answers, each of which are equally viable options (or alternatively a single answer which contains all possible alternative projections, which is impractical to compile). Your original question was actually slightly better, or at least heading in a better direction, because it mentioned the idea of a &lt;code&gt;Camera&lt;/code&gt; class supporting atypical projections. But not a single one of the edits made to the question as of this posting corrects its &quot;too broad&quot; nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you flagged the post after you edited it, asking to get it re-opened. This itself is not really a problem, although it's not a particularly good use of a moderator flag since editing a question puts it into the re-open review queue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I am aware of the guidelines &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/help/reopen-questions&quot;&gt;that you linked&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;(a)&lt;/em&gt; that does not mandate that all such flags must be acted on by re-opening the question and &lt;em&gt;(b)&lt;/em&gt; I suspect those guidelines were written prior to the more-recent change that automatically puts edited questions into the re-open queue, or at least are less relevant now since that feature exists.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, your edit did not make the question re-openable, and as such I rejected the flag, choosing one of the (pre-defined) reasons available to me. There are several such pre-defined options, a few of which were potentially applicable. I chose &quot;doesn't require intervention&quot; simply because your edit wasn't sufficiently good enough to warrant re-opening by unilateral vote. I did not elect to use the custom decline reason field because I didn't think it was warranted here; perhaps I was wrong in that respect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you flagged the question again, with effectively the same reason; that isn't appropriate use of the flag system. &quot;Spamming&quot; in that context did not mean you are flagging &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt; times, it meant you are re-flagging without sufficient further action or change, which is not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did not close the question impulsively (on a whim). In fact, I saw it in its original form and left it alone for a while to think about how it could be tweaked to make it more appropriate. When I came back, you'd edited it to make it &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; broad, so I closed it then. It was hardly a snap decision; I rarely make snap decisions when closing questions, unless they are spam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's really no way to make a question asking for a list salvageable here. It's just not the appropriate venue. However, your original question had some mention of implementing non-standard projections in camera classes, and a question that proposed a specific non-standard projection and asked about how you might represent the parameters to that projection in a &lt;code&gt;Camera&lt;/code&gt; that also supported a &quot;typical&quot; projection might be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:37:42.347" LastActivityDate="2014-06-22T21:25:40.580" CommentCount="5" />

Please add details to narrow the answer set&#xA;  or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First: this doesn't mean they are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; questions, or that the people participating in the close vote are trying to be &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;. I am genuinely interested in the cause of the bug you are describing, but it would be wrong of me (&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; as a moderator) not to vote to close your question as it was asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second: precisely what constitutes &quot;too broad&quot; varies somewhat between SE sites. SO's definition may be more lax than ours. Or it could simply be that nobody with sufficient voting privileges on SO's &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more massive site saw the question in a reasonable timeframe. It's generally not a useful argument to point to another borderline-poor question and say &quot;but this one is still open,&quot; because that usually just means you call attention to a question that should also be closed that just managed to slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third: the argument that a broad question should be acceptable because one of the many potential speculative answers might lead you to, or actually be, the correct answer doesn't hold on SE. That isn't the kind of question SE is dedicated to archiving (with the outlying exceptions of some of the &quot;softer&quot; sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Programmers&lt;/a&gt;). On SE, we want to keep specific questions with specific answers; for everything else, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamedev.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;. Your question isn't specific enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You haven't provided much information. Potential answers that tightly bound the limited information you have provided are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;, even if most of them are wrong. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XNA itself does not have a commonly-report bug regarding the window &quot;shaking&quot; on Windows builds (there many reports of things shaking, but they are almost exclusively having to do with things like half-pixel offsets of window &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, which don't fit your description thus far.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One doesn't need to know anything about the specific issue to know that the reported issue is too broad. &quot;Why does my game crash?&quot; is too broad a question regardless of if I've ever seen your source code.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A question that requires intensely project-specific knowledge (such as a bug known to an internal or former XNA developer) is too &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt;, relying on the assumption that such a rare beast will happen to stumble across the question. We do have a few people here who &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; worked on XNA, but this isn't a site to ask &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; questions specifically. Since we no longer have the &quot;too localized&quot; close reason, we actually tend to (amusingly) close these questions as &quot;too broad&quot; since they fall under the umbrella of &quot;everybody else without the specific knowledge would have to speculate.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, a question with so little information could have a straightforward answer; for your question that might be &quot;the window shakes because of bug #6182 in XNA,&quot; as you initially hypothesize. But for another user searching this site for &quot;why does my XNA window shake?&quot; the answer might be because they adjust the position of the window themselves, accidentally, somewhere in their render function. The lack of scoping information in your question makes it hard for that future user to disambiguate your problem from theirs (because they were very different problems even if they have similar symptoms). An important goal of SE is to collect questions and answers for &lt;em&gt;posterity&lt;/em&gt;, not just to solve an individual users problems, and these sorts of questions are counter to that goal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speculation is for forums, not GDSE. It doesn't matter that a million monkeys speculating might eventually produce an answer that is, or leads you to, the solution. That's a great process (bouncing the problem off others), it's just &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what this site is for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do happen to know a fair bit about XNA, enough to know that this issue you've described &lt;em&gt;as you have described it&lt;/em&gt; is very unlikely to be a problem purely in XNA's code. Something about your code is causing (directly or indirectly) the behavior, which means some of your code (or a video of your bug) is going to be necessary to diagnose the problem. That starts to get into &quot;debug my code&quot; question territory, which is why it's probably better you hash out the problem in the [chat] first to get all the back-and-forth involved in those questions out of the way, and then edit your question with the clarified information from that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-12T07:31:59.523" LastActivityDate="2014-07-02T01:07:16.943" CommentCount="6" />

I wasn't really aware of this jam before just some days before it began. I really didn't know what to make. That night I watched a youtuber play a ton of simulator games and with them Goat Petting Simulator. I suddenly got the idea of basing my game jam entry on that game. Goat Petting Simulator is just about petting a goat, there is no goal or winning or losing. In the beginning I felt like it was going to be really stupid, but it turned out to be an acceptable game called Box Petting Simulator. I have gotten nice comments on it and the developer of Goat Petting Simulator himself has commented that my game is better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are way this and the original game is made is alike. Both are made in unity. And the concept is there. The thing is that in my game there is some improvements :D You have six boxes. You get one petting point by petting it gently. If you are not gently you destroy it. The game is over when all the boxes are &quot;killed&quot;. You can submit the highscore as a user at gamejolt, as a guest or don't submit at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The controls are really easy. Move with WASD or arrow keys. Move the arm by moving the camera. And if you need more explanation you can click buttons which appears and write in textareas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now the moment you all have been waiting for!

You press the buttons 1 through 4 to create an orb (Water, Fire, Earth, Air). You launch these orbs by clicking where you want them to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they collide with an enemy, the enemy get's hurt. If they collide with you... so do you!  But if they collide with a different orb there's a reaction, Fire and Air hitting each other creates Lightning orbs, Lightning and Earth hitting each other... destroys both of the orbs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a turn based game, think about where to send your orbs and where to step to avoid getting hit, it gets hectic quite fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the game is to... survive, your orbs aren't peculiar about who they hurt and your HP is limited, try to get a high score! - I can't really get over 200.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0d21C.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A gif of me playing the game&quot;&gt;(Full version: &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0d21C.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0d21C.gif&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more orb options to build in, and a lot of tidying up, which I might get to sometime after the jam, but for now I think it's done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The py2exe windows version is available via Dropbox, nothing extra required, just unzip somewhere and run the .exe:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1193507/MagiOnslaught.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1193507/MagiOnslaught.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've put the code on github and if anyone wants to help they're welcome: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KevinVDVelden/MagiOnslaught&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://github.com/KevinVDVelden/MagiOnslaught&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The version on github uses cygwin and has version 1.5.2 of libtcod, the py2exe version uses the MSVC build of libtcod which is version 1.5.1.

I made some edits and began making my case for having it reopened which was redirected to a Meta post. I won't get into more details as that Meta post can be read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I finally found the answer to my own question. The entire reason I had asked was I had hoped someone would recognize the symptoms of my problem and be able to direct me to a solution. Did it require research and debugging code? Yes, but only if you're unfamiliar with the problem. It would've been well within the realm of possibility for someone to answer with &quot;That sounds exactly like this bug with MediaPlayer I've run into, I bet you're using that incorrectly,&quot; even without my mentioning MediaPlayer (my code is fairly complex, making narrowing down causes especially difficult).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of my question/post here is, does anyone not find it absurd that I had to answer my own question to even be allowed to ask the question? Had I been able to narrow down the problem I'd never have asked it in the first place, because I'd be able to fix the problem myself (which I have fixed it by now, knowing MediaPlayer's bug was causing it). I came to GameDev with the hopes of avoiding endless debugging and had no intention of wanting others to speculate or help me debug. I was simply hoping for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This incident has left me feeling this StackExchange is too strict in its rules, and honestly makes me not want to ask any more questions (what's the point if I have to get 99% of the way to the answer before being allowed to ask?). Bugs without relevant code are not automatically impossible to recognize nor do they automatically have many causes that would necessitate needing more details. And just because the reader of the question doesn't know the answer, and would have to research just like the asker, does not automatically mean there's nobody out there who could give a good definitive answer (without needing all the explicit details uncovered by thorough debugging).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a poor analogy, it's like being stuck on a complex math problem, asking for help, and being told &quot;Can you narrow down the problem to where it's just adding two numbers? Then I can help&quot;. But I can also add two numbers, so what's the point of my even asking?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="222" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.557" LastActivityDate="2018-02-02T04:25:03.397" Title="Had To Answer My Own Question To Be Allowed To Ask It?"

I don't think the work it would take to get this far is as extreme as you claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize you said it's a poor analogy, but if you said you were stuck on a complex math problem, only told us you were using Calculus, and said you were seeing 5 as a result when you were expecting -3 but did not include any details on the steps you took to reach the conclusion of 5 no one would be able to help you. To expand upon your analogy further, yes there are probably people who know calculus who could help you reach -3... the problem is you might get 12 different approaches on how to reach -3 and given how little information that was provided in the original question that was asked, the one answer that helped you is technically not more correct than the other 11 making the question no longer about a specific problem you are having and about a generic problem anyone using calculus is having. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example, just to show you what we would be subjecting ourselves to if we don't define a clear line, would be a question as such:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I tried implementing proper collision resolution but the player just walks through solid objects. What are some common issues with collision resolution that might be able to help me solve this issue?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above is just awful because there is no way someone could reasonably help this person without lengthy discussion or flat out guessing. The issue could be because of his collision resolution code, his collision detection code, or maybe he's using a physics library and he's implemented movement in a way that doesn't support the provided physics. I'm sure someone out there has seen his problem before and might have an idea as to what was done wrong based on his description, but if a person cannot answer a question with some degree of confidence I don't think that person should be attempting to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can come up with how we draw the line between why you feel your question is appropriate vs keeping questions like the example above out I'm open to suggestions but if we cannot objectively define that line I think I have to lean on the side of believing that questions, such as yours, are off topic for the site because they don't provide enough context (too broad) to aid in answering the question with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13052" LastActivityDate="2014-07-11T14:32:16.097" CommentCount="8" />

There is some merit to that criticism: as diamond moderators, we should be acting as exception handlers rather than active enforcers. There are several reasons having to step in as frequently as we do is bad:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It shapes the community around &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; bias rather than that of the larger userbase. There are four of us, compared to many thousands of non-diamonds. That kind of skew in the direction of the community is undesirable. It goes against much of the StackExchange philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It reinforces the precedent that we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; step in, leaving the people with the power to vote-to-close less interested in doing so because one of us will take care of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It means the quality bar of available questions fluctuates drastically when the four of us aren't around or as active (typically on weekends).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It upsets people whose questions are closed due to a perception (grounded in reality) of unfairness or arbitrary closure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I worry about the quality level of questions here, especially since the Graphics Programming SE got promoted to beta and will likely skim off a good portion of our good questions. Part of the problem with question quality is not having the community have a clear understanding of what it's guidelines should be, and if it isn't capable of exercising those guidelines itself it cannot develop that clear picture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past I have justified most of my unilateral decisions by arguing that question quality needs to be kept high to keep the site afloat and we don't currently have enough active 3k+ users to close bad stuff quickly enough for neophyte-but-well-meaning users to post answers and start reinforcing a precedent that those bad questions are not okay. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when I saw the question, and its similar in structure to a few other borderline questions we've had recently, I decided &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to unilaterally close it to see if the community would do so instead. Indeed, I had noted a slight but visible increase in the number of community-closed questions recently. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like enough has changed quite yet; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/review/close/stats&quot;&gt;review stats suggest&lt;/a&gt; that only a handful of users with close-vote power actually bother to review questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.557" LastActivityDate="2014-07-22T21:20:01.720" CommentCount="0" />

Is just a personal challenge. After trying out tutorials, tools, books etc. I felt that I was just pushing the act of making a game further and further away, so finally one day I got down to it and started coding a game. Sure, its far from perfect, but at least is my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;On a game design level&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have quite a few ideas for videogames in my head, but this one seems not to be overly ambitious and fit for an opera prima. The specific idea for this game came to my mind one day sitting in a friend house. We were discussing how hard is to find offline cooperative games, where you can just physically sit in the same room as your friends and play together. The I had an idea, what about a game that must be played two players, and where being physically close to each other played a part in the gameplay?.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Little by little this idea took shape in the form of Nemesis Sidekick, and I expanded it a little bit with other interesting gameplay concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First the game is two players only, and both players play in the same keyboard. This forces players to be very close to each other, and this has some implications. As the game was conceived as competitive in nature, I pictured players harassing and messing with each other in order to get an advantage in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to make the experience more interesting, I decided to add a second, cooperative game mode, where I could experiment with other mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the current iteration, the competitive mode (Nemesis) requires one player to eliminate the other and beat the level (right now only points are counted) to be the winner. The little twist is that when a player dies, he gets a speed and power buff. That means that every time your enemy becomes more and more dangerous, and sort of balances the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cooperative mode (Sidekick) requires both players to survive and beat the level together. The twist here is that friendly fire is enabled, and the death buff is applied to the other player when one dies. So, in the one hand you want your partner to survive in order to beat the level, but on the other you would like that sweet sweet buff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Current state and future plans&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The project has been stale for a month due to me changing jobs, country and not having internet at home. Hopefully I can get back on the road again soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game currently has mostly placeholder graphics and sound/music, and the levels and enemies are just testing prototypes. Also the game hasn't been playtested by anybody else than me, so I didn't had any feedback about the game system. Right now I am more concerned about learning how to make games, and my aim is to put in place some basic system that can be extended to produce a complete game. Of course I am open for anybody who wants to contribute, collaborations are always welcome!.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48906" LastEditorUserId="48906" LastEditDate="2014-07-28T16:11:15.253" LastActivityDate="2014-07-28T16:11:15.253" CommentCount="0" />

They stopped being &quot;explain this concept to me&quot;, and instead became &quot;write some code for me for free.&quot;  Or to put it differently;  the questions stopped being interesting resources for learning, and started being a do-it-for-me service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deep down, I feel like spending time on crafting answers to the majority of questions on this site doesn't add value to the Internet any more, the way that it used to;  it's just helping individual users one at a time, by giving them my time in exchange for nothing at all;  often not even gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I kind of feel like maybe I'm not in the site's target market any more.

That is, questions voted +2 or higher look pretty legitimate.  And the ones voted -1 or lower look less ideal, in terms of being the type of questions we want to encourage on this site.  This suggests that the voting members of the community are still successfully identifying good questions -- the problem we're perceiving is just the ratio of bad questions to good ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, out of 48 questions on our front page, 11 of them have a vote score of +2 or higher.  6 have a vote score of +4 or higher.  10 have a vote score of -1 or lower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing to other SE sites:  On Stack Overflow, 9 of the 48 front page questions have a vote score of +2. 2 have a vote score of +4 or higher  And 2 have a vote score of -1 or lower.  (Note that Stack Overflow gets a much higher volume of questions;  the vast majority of their questions have zero votes in total)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Superuser, 12 out of their 48 front page questions have a vote score of +2 or higher, and 10 have a vote score of +4 or higher.  4 have a vote score of -1 or lower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Per-site front page stats&lt;/strong&gt; (&quot;voted up&quot; == +2 or higher, &quot;voted down&quot; == -1 or lower)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stack Overflow: 20% voted up, 4% voted down&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Superuser:  20% voted up, 8% voted down&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;GameDev: 20% voted up, 20% voted down&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's interesting (and perhaps surprising) that the percentage of up-voted questions on the front page turns out to be almost identical between the three sites, even with Stack Overflow's substantially higher churn rate.  The real difference between the questions shown on the front-page of the different sites seems to be in how many of the non-great questions are bad enough to attract down-votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether any other SE sites have down-vote rates similar to ours?  We might be able to learn from them, if they've dealt with this situation in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the sake of interest, here's a graph showing the percentage of GameDev.SE questions asked in different months that were downvoted to -1 or below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6N0dQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;GameDev&amp;#39;s percent of questions downvoted per month&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this shows a big peak of downvoted questions a little over a year ago, after which it fell right off, only to have a few brief peaks later on, including a big one that appears to be going on right now, which lends some support to @Anko's suspicions.  But even these big peaks are topping out only at about 15% of questions being downvoted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here's another interesting graph, this one showing the percentage of questions asked in GameDev.SE each month which would eventually wind up with a score of at least 4:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XPcOv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Percentage of questions which score &amp;gt;= 4 points&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this isn't a cumulative graph;  pretty regularly, month-on-month, we've had a lower and lower percentage of questions reaching a +4 score ever since the site opened.  In July of 2011, nearly 50% of all questions asked were reaching a score of at least +4.  In July of this year, only 4% of questions reached +4.

I don't know what, but the number of questions (as seen in the graph in the original question) and the number of votes being cast (seen here) were both at a peak, the number of zero-vote questions was under control, and then over the course of two months, question submissions dropped by a quarter, and voting rates were cut in half.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the point at which the zero-voted questions really started to grow quickly;  we stopped having as many up-voted questions because people &lt;em&gt;had actually stopped voting&lt;/em&gt;, and for half a year voting levels were lower than this site had seen at any other point in its history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that there was a brief up-swing in voting activity around April 2014, almost back to its historically normal levels, and there was a surge in question submissions back to their normal level at that same time.  But the number of zero-voted questions continued to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that while this graph shows us as being in a steep dip right now (August 2014), that's because we're only halfway through the month.  If things stay as they are, we're roughly on track to hit about the same number of upvotes on questions as last month, and substantially more downvotes than last month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;: The graph in the original question is showing current scores and open/closed status for questions based upon the month in which the question was asked.  Having gone over the voting data while preparing my graph, I've observed that a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of votes get cast on old questions;  if I categorise votes based upon the date of the question they were applied to (rather than based upon the date the vote was actually cast), then this graph looks extremely different, because a surprising number of these votes were being cast against questions which were already very old, at the time the vote was being cast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that the whole &quot;look at how many more zero-voted questions there are now than there were back then&quot; premise of the discussion may not be a valid conclusion to draw from the original graph -- it may turn out that there are fewer zero-voted questions in the past just because there has been more time for people to cast votes on those older questions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be possible to correct for this;  perhaps to only count votes which were cast within a month of when the question was asked.  If anyone's interested, that would be a really useful bit of analysis to run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7728" LastEditorUserId="7728" LastEditDate="2014-08-17T16:16:32.440" LastActivityDate="2014-08-17T16:16:32.440" CommentCount="2" />

The reality is that the code for picking up a specific weapon may not exist. Even if the code did exist, maybe the engine contains the ability to handle certain triggers such as picking up a weapon? Maybe there is an OnItemPickup event that the askers code could hook onto? Wouldn't these be better solutions than modifying engine code directly? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the asker had asked something more like &quot;How do I implement awarding an achievement on pickup of a specific weapon?&quot; instead of &quot;Where can I find the code for picking up a specific weapon?&quot; we end up with a better quality question and a better quality answer that more people are going to be able to use because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final note, if the solution to a problem actually requires locating and modifying code it will be answered as such regardless of what the question is.

A prime example is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Role-Playing Games SE&lt;/a&gt;, where the content is almost entirely opinion-based and everyone likes it that way.

These updates served as dialogue between the answers the OP was receiving and how that user would like answers to be catered. This ultimately lead to answers addressing the OP's specific needs and &quot;bad subjective&quot; (in my opinion) additional questions that were added as opposed to the &quot;good subjective&quot; (again, in my opinion and perhaps the 18 users that voted up) original question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My general thought process for salvaging the question would be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove the updates to restore the original intent that likely drew in the up&#xA;votes as well as the good answers. This would bring us back to a good, albeit poorly written, subjective question&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the question was not reopened effort would then be taken to actually improve the question to be higher quality and to advocate needs of answers often found in good subjective types of questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the time I just wanted to get the ball rolling on this and see how the community reacted, though ideally I would have addressed both items at the same time so that multiple edits did not have to occur. That said, I completed step one above. I removed the two updates leaving the top section intact to see where things would go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The process ended much sooner than expected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My edit was rejected with the following, rather unexpected, reason by both users who reviewed the edit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This edit changes too much in the original post; the original meaning or intent of the post would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have the privileges to review edits so I don't know what canned options are available so maybe this just comes down to having limited choices when rejecting edits... I can only speculate. Needless to say I was certainly glad I didn't take the effort to complete step 2 with my original edit because that would have changed the original post even further making the close reason seem slightly more valid - but with the edit that was made the reject reason is a bit baffling to me since I edited the question down to the original question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Is there anything that can be done to save the question?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point I don't know exactly what to do.

The jams we run here are solo projects (although there has been some talk about teaming up), and we run them over a weekend, starting on Friday. They can be lots of fun, and you end up with something playable at the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Theme&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alex started a thread a while back asking &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1685/the-anniversary-gamejam&quot;&gt;what theme we should run this time&lt;/a&gt;, and the community has voted for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potluck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Potluck&lt;/a&gt; theme:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Before the start, everyone submits 5 &quot;foods&quot; (English words) into a common &quot;buffet&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At the start, the words are shuffled and dealt to participants, so everyone has 5 random words from what others brought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Pick 3 of those.

Constructive subjective questions...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;tend to have long, not short, answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;invite sharing experiences over opinions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;are more than just mindless social fun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&lt;/a&gt; post there is mention of a &quot;back it up&quot; principal that &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/167259/how-widespread-is-the-back-it-up-principle&quot;&gt;has been instated in other SE sites.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Back It Up! means that your answers must be based on either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Something that happened to you personally&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Something you can back up with a reference&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;They talk about how “opinion, by itself, is noise.” They’re not saying that subjective opinions are to be avoided; they’re attempting to mold and shape their inherently subjective Q&amp;amp;A into something constructive, informative and helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Game design is naturally a rather subjective topic and as a result it is very easy to ask subjective questions on the site which, more often than not, don't meet the above criteria. The subjective questions that get asked are often too broad or appear to be discussion oriented in nature. This results in questions (often times interesting questions) getting put on hold / closed as well as confusion in the community as to whether or not design questions are actually allowed to be asked on the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that by implementing some sort of &quot;back it up&quot; policy we could loosen up the rules a little bit on questions being asked and be more strict on the answers. I believe this could invite more interesting questions and answers into the site which I think could lead to increased user participation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would expect a noticable shift in site activity / moderation to be something as described below if such a policy were instated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From an asker's perspective:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Less focus on phrasing subjective questions so that they fit perfectly in the above guidelines which would allow interesting questions that users like to answer to stay open and receive reputation on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Less fear of down votes / closed questions simply because the question they have is subjective in nature / design related&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continued effort to keep the question as high quality and narrow in scope as possible, though some broadness may be more forgivable under such a policy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From an answerer's perspective:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More focus on providing high quality answers that are backed up by facts, references, and experiences rather than opinion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More effort put into answers to subjective questions due to policy that is in place which doesn't allow an answerer to simply throw up their opinion for quick reputation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a voter's or moderator's perspective: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increased moderation and voting on answers to subjective questions to make sure that answers are not just spouting off opinion which makes the answers more useful to users who would visit the site&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Decreased down votes and close votes on questions simply because the question is subjective, broad in scope, or discussion oriented &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continued voting down and/or to close questions and answers that are not a good fit for the site - i.e. not all subjective questions should stay open just because the policy makes the rules a little looser than they currently are.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such a policy could have some negative effects on GDSE as well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This would absolutely require increased moderation on answers. Currently it's easy to close questions that would encourage bad answers and such a policy would provide more opportunity for bad answers since some questions that may have been closed in the past could stay open under such a policy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This potentially would create an even larger grey area of what types of questions are allowed vs what types aren't which could result in a confused user base and an increase of &quot;but this was left open / why was this closed&quot; meta posts. (potentially mitigated by a clearly defined policy but moderation is always subjective)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This does open up the site to questions which won't necessarily have a single best answer (I personally think this is ok but would be a big change and not the traditional SE way)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you think GDSE could benefit from such a policy to the point where it's worth having further meta discussion on it? Is it redundant with current SE policy and subsequently unnecessary? Or do you feel this would be an unwelcome change for a Stack Exchange site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This probably goes without saying, but please do not vote on this question as your response.

For quite a while I was looking for ways to run the campaign on Kickstarter (it does not support Ukraine), but could not as there are zero information on the web about it. Our only option was to run the campaign on Idiegogo instead which is, shortly speaking, 10 times less effective. Recently I heard from a friend that there is a service that facilitates using Kickstarter in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I believe that the following question should be on stackoverflow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can I launch a Kickstarter campaign for my game from all over the world?&quot; with an answer, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is why I believe Stackoverflow is the best place for it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency. Stackoverflow allows to upvote/devote questions, therefore, in the end of the day it will not be a dumb advertisement but a credible q&amp;amp;a evaluated by public. If the service is good, the answer will have upvotes, if it's not - it will go below zero, therefore visitors will immediately see a)a possible solution and b)the quality of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamedev is the right place to be. Kickstarter is unparalleled in it's ability to raise funds for indie game developers and stackoverflow's gamedev section is the place where every self-respecting game developer goes at least several times a week. I believe that it's only logical that such question appears in this section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamedev already has similar questions. Marketing aspects of game development are quite often discussed on Stackoverflow.

Click on the nucleus again to reset. To skip between levels, click the little level indicators around the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;: (The levels are tutorial-like, so maybe just play it.) Electrons move clockwise along their orbits. Each has a &quot;spin&quot; (direction indicated by icon), which determines whether it stays at the same orbit height (square), rises by one every step (up arrow) or drops by one every step (down arrow). Electrons disappear if they go above the highest orbit or lower than the lowest. When an electron destroys an anti-electron, it absorbs its spin and starts moving in that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Tech overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://livescript.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;LiveScript&lt;/a&gt;, rendered in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://d3js.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;D3.js&lt;/a&gt;.

That is, many participants are already GDSE &quot;outsiders&quot;, which means the meta requirement is an arbitrary limitation to participation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening up the jam has advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: it exposes GDSE to a wider audience, attracts more entries and voters which improves the overall quality of the jam - more feedback, more competition, more ideas showcased, more games to try for judges. The current size of GDSE jams are on the extreme low end as far as jams go. As a developer, this size is too small for me: chances are my submission will get 0 constructive feedback, which means I don't know what other people liked or didn't like, which means I don't get to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another point I want to make is that &lt;strong&gt;hosting jams elsewhere is easy&lt;/strong&gt;. There are services like itch.io or gamejolt which allow anyone to freely start a jam, and all the infrastructure is in place: submissions, voting, deadlines. In itch.io's case, just sign up, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://itch.io/jams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://itch.io/jams&lt;/a&gt; and click the &quot;Host your own jam&quot; button.

Most were already closed, usually because they were &quot;debug my problem&quot; questions or generic programming questions dealing with compile error messages. Many were incorrectly tagged (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/74412/unresolved-external-symbol-errors-in-directx-lnk1120-and-lnk2019&quot;&gt;actually being about &lt;em&gt;link&lt;/em&gt; problems&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/37813/variables-in-static-library-are-never-initialized-why&quot;&gt;runtime behavior issues&lt;/a&gt;) anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Compilation&quot; can refer to a lot of things. It can refer to the compilation of C++ programs, or programs in other language. It can refer to the compilation of shaders, or the compilation of data. In all cases the word is the same, referring to the general process of &lt;em&gt;producing something from some other set of things&lt;/em&gt;, but the actual details of the underlying process are not. Thus, it is unlikely that there are any experts on the general process of &lt;em&gt;compilation&lt;/em&gt; that are not experts on &lt;em&gt;compiler theory&lt;/em&gt; (which is a topic of SO, not here). The wide variety of meanings of &quot;compilation&quot; eliminates the categorization (and searchability) utility of the tag entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I culled out the questions that were off-topic, or used the tag totally incorrectly, we have a grand total of two questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/87116/do-you-need-visual-c-2013-to-compile-unreal-4&quot;&gt;Do you need Visual C 2013 to compile Unreal 4?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/84447/do-i-have-to-compile-unreal-4s-source-myself-in-order-to-make-games-with-it&quot;&gt;Do I have to compile Unreal 4&amp;#39;s source myself in order to make games with it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't think these are great questions in general, but I also don't think the &lt;code&gt;compilation&lt;/code&gt; tag even fits them. The first question is not asking anything about the compilation process, it's just asking if you need a specific version of tool to do a specific thing with a library. &lt;code&gt;compilation&lt;/code&gt; doesn't help much here, because the version incompabilities extend into domains &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; just the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question isn't asking about the compilation process either, it's just asking &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; one has to compile the engine from source to use it (a &lt;em&gt;yes-or-no&lt;/em&gt; question, incidentally).

One problem with closing (as off-topic) is that, by saying &quot;we don't welcome questions like these&quot;, we're implicitly saying &quot;we don't welcome you here&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1692/can-we-please-be-more-friendly-to-new-users&quot;&gt;we drive away users&lt;/a&gt; who probably don't come back, even when they've gained enough experience to be able to contribute better to this site. Instead, if we build a collection of softball or canonical questions and redirect duplicates to these, we can say &quot;this is a better way of asking questions here&quot;, which encourages people to stick around and learn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from answering common questions, we can also help narrow down those too-broad, opinion-based questions. Often what the asker really needs is information to help her make a decision, and I think for many opinion-based questions, there are ways to address them in a fact-based manner. To make a car analogy, in order to answer the question &quot;what car should I buy&quot;, instead of having a huge poll with options like &quot;Toyota&quot; or &quot;Sedan&quot;, a good answer might follow up with a list of criteria such as &quot;what's your budget&quot; or &quot;what will be the primary use&quot;. Only the asker can make the final decision, but at least she can now make a more informed decision, or follow up with more specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we can use the refactor as an excuse to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How this might work&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Find a type of question that keeps getting asked and closed as off-topic, but might be addressable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ask the question in the most generic, broadly-applicable way possible, maybe with a tag like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/softball&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;softball&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;softball&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/canonical&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;canonical&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;canonical&lt;/a&gt; and marked as CW&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Answer and revise as usual, avoiding opinion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Where suitable, mark other questions as duplicates of these&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At the end of the event, publish a list of top contributors to these questions (# of questions/answers, score, # of duplicates), with awards like bounties or hats if they can be arranged&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26250" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.557" LastActivityDate="2014-12-09T01:33:08.197" CommentCount="3" />

I don't understand the reasoning behind this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to know why the effort to why fix them other than to make metrics look nicer? Below are my reasons for thinking its a counter productive effort that stifles current activity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Reasoning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First there is little to no incentive to go back and answer these question and the incentives that exist are not community driven. I'm referring to the bounties that seem to have been offered from the 2013 Refactoring thread. Though well intentioned I don't like this sort of behavior, personally I would rather solve the issue through leveraging community involvement through using the existing site mechanics as they were intended. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second most of them are subtly unanswerable. Either they are off topic or they develop to become too localized. The few good unanswered question I could find are unanswered because the question is brutally hard. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question is one that the community has an interest in getting answered it will be asked again. This time with the opportunity of having the attention of the current community on it. If it deserves to be closed it is more likely to be closed. If it deserves to be answered its more likely to be answered (due to visibility allowing for more up-votes and the possibility of engaging the OP in necessary). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems purging them would increase activity and the quality of the site as a QA forum. Additionally I help prevent stagnation cause by those questions causing similar ones (that may be a better fit) to be off topic. To elaborate think of a venn diagram, the questions remove the incentives for a sizable circle area within the circle that is all on topic question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I figure there will be examples of questions that are popular though unanswered. The purging can of course have exceptions based upon votes/views but that should not a part of this discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Edits to Address Points Made in the Answers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I believe the goal behind both ideas is to bring attention to the questions. The Refactor address this by using (mostly) artificial incentives to involve a small subset of the community (the ones who participate in meta - the ones who don't feel like participating). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deleting and allowing the questions to be re-asked &lt;strong&gt;involves the entire active community&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to using the incentive system the site is built around. The bold bit being the important distinction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I suppose deletion wouldn't be necessary. Perhaps a mass closing would be less absolute option? I fully understanding not wanting to be the person who name is on the deletions.

There are a lot of reasons it may have simply failed to get any traction when it was originally posted; perhaps, for example, there was nobody on the site at the time who was knowledgeable in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is lots of talk about &quot;fixing the site&quot; and its said that&#xA;  answering unanswered question is a good way to do this. I don't&#xA;  understand the reasoning behind this. I would like to know why the effort to why fix them other than to make metrics look nicer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there have been discussions about addressing perceived or actual problems with the site (such as relatively poor participation in certain community actions), the Winter Refactor event isn't aimed at &quot;fixing&quot; anything, necessarily. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answering unanswered questions &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good for the site, since it's basically what the site is about. The event isn't &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; adjusting metrics (but having metrics is useful to gauge the success of the event). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, that said, metrics &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; important because if the site's metrics skew way out of line it could be closed (this is a general truth; I'm not saying &lt;em&gt;this site&lt;/em&gt; is in danger of that, or anything). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Though well intentioned I don't like this sort of behavior, personally&#xA;  I would rather solve the issue through leveraging community&#xA;  involvement through using the existing site mechanics as they were&#xA;  intended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of the bounty mechanism as an incentive to participate either. I would rather there be something else but I don't know what it could be. We have to work with the tools we're given and we're not given particularly good tools for this sort of scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Second most of them are subtly unanswerable. Either they are off topic&#xA;  or they develop to become too localized. The few good unanswered&#xA;  question I could find are unanswered because the question is brutally&#xA;  hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's fine; vote to close them then. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; the question would eventually get deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It seems purging them would increase activity and the quality of the&#xA;  site as a QA forum. This time with the opportunity of having the attention of the current community on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see how? Without a good reason why, I'm loathe to and arbitrarily delete &quot;anything older than date &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; that has 0 answers and a score of less then 5&quot; or something. Especially since it would basically have to be me (or one of the other diamond moderators) doing all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for &quot;having the attention of the current community,&quot; &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; the point of the Refactor event: to focus the effort of the community on a section of the site's questions that, due to the way the site operates, are no longer &quot;in the spotlight.&quot; We don't need to delete questions to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastActivityDate="2014-12-11T21:55:57.833" CommentCount="1" />

Specifically, I want to address this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Deleting and allowing the questions to be re-asked involves the entire&#xA;  active community in addition to using the incentive system the site is&#xA;  built around. The bold bit being the important distinction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I see where you are coming from. It seems to me that you're saying that by deleting the question, and having somebody (possibly eventually) re-answer it, the entire current community will see the new question since it we appear on the front page of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the same can be said of the process of &lt;em&gt;editing&lt;/em&gt; the original old question: it will be bumped up to the front page, making it more likely to get visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we're going to delete and wait until somebody re-asks, we're not really involving the entire community until it gets asked. Until then, we're waiting on one of the potential few people who actually have that question to ask it. We might lose that question for a long time, which would be sad if it was a good question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we're going to delete and immediately re-ask on the original poster's behalf, that's functionally the same as simply editing the existing question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why not just go back and edit old questions instead? I still would argue that it involves the community more: more people can edit than can delete, and those edits will push the questions to the front. Plus I think there's a difference between &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; a question and being able to see a question somebody has and think &quot;that is an interesting problem.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/88169/how-can-i-detect-connected-but-logically-distinct-bodies-of-water-in-a-2d-map&quot;&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt; for example, is not one that I would likely ever have in the near future given what I work on, but I think it's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the act of simply going through and unilaterally axing a bunch of old questions seems very much against the spirit of the site.

Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

We already have a dearth of users at the high-end, but allowing this at a low level creates all kinds of other issues.  One unscrupulous empowered user with 1k rep, and we'll see swarms of noise in the chat.  And related, what would you do with such a user excessively granting this power to new users?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What do you do with users who ought not have been given the privilege, but received it anyway?  Is there a separate, permanent  &quot;override/reverse&quot; of this privilege available at an even higher rep level, or would that be reserved for diamonds?

Likewise, frivolous and/or excessive moderation just needs to be (re)defined. A user that flags a question for editing, rather than make the edit that they are (overly)qualified to make themselves, should lose &quot;moderation points&quot; to encourage them to &quot;get dirty&quot;. Does a second moderator &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to be notified and manually come in after XX days/months to re-moderate it? Why is one moderator not enough?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another of my analogies:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This reminds me of Office Space where the management is constantly complaining about the workload and hassle of dealing with &quot;TPS reports&quot;. We find out later it's actually his secretary's, secretary's, secretary that actually does all the work regarding them. Another employee explains that he &quot;deals with the customer so the engineers don't have to&quot; and when the &quot;Bob's&quot; (firing consultants) ask him &quot;What, &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, do you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; here?&quot;, he has no (good) answer. The employee just hysterically repeats &quot;Look, I told you!! I deal with the GD customer's so the engineers don't have to&quot;. Ultimately, management was about to be &lt;strong&gt;reorganized and made to work&lt;/strong&gt; when the office mysteriously burned down...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we need that here, now, because the end-result of moderation should always be either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The question being answered  &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The question being deleted&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current moderation system guarantees neither. The many thousands of moderated, but unanswered, questions lingering highlights that.

The blog post on good subjective vs bad subjective has some good blurbs on why we are the way we are, and while it talks specifically to subjective and discussion oriented questions the general philosophy applies to all bad questions really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Most forums and chat rooms have a scale problem. As in, they don’t. The more people that join the discussion, the more noise each of those connections bring. So the forums get progressively noisier and noisier, and suddenly one day … you stop learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Because we believe so deeply in learning, we are willing to go to great lengths to suppress the discussion, debate, and opinions that — while plenty entertaining — cause most forums to inevitably break down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without the rules we have and the moderators that are incredibly passionate to uphold the rules StackExchange sites will live on and continue to serve as useful places to gather and consume information. You may or may not notice a lot more noise (not useful information / answers) on other sites such as the Unity Answers site.

Regular users have throttles on their ability to perform moderation actions via flag and review limits per 24-hour period. The amount of flags a user can raise (and the weight of those flags) is governed by the software based on how valid those flags were as reviewed by others. Similarly, reviews have built-in checks and tests (although I don't think this site specifically is large enough to have them active) and there must generally be a consensus on a review vote from regular users to actually have any action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The few diamond moderators the site has (who were &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/election/&quot;&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt;; there is no other way to become one) have more-or-less unrestricted ability to moderate the site and serve as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;community exception handlers&lt;/a&gt;. We mostly deal with the obviously horrible crap, like spam and other sorts of offensive behavior. We also frequently make unilateral decisions &lt;em&gt;based on the policies that have been agreed upon by this site's community&lt;/em&gt; to close, modify, or other moderate certain questions. Campaigning to change &lt;em&gt;those policies&lt;/em&gt; is (to an extent) a better way to enact a change than proposing getting rid of diamond moderators altogether (which, incidentally, is something only a StackExchange staff member could put into effect).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address a few of your specific points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Answering a question&quot;, from a moderation standpoint, could be as&#xA;  simple as deleting a question rather than just marking it as &quot;not our&#xA;  problem&quot; or &quot;try again&quot; (and letting it sit there for years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Most) users don't get to see deleted posts, so simply deleting them can be confusing. That's why instead, we put them on hold, with information about why the question is on hold and what can be done to improve upon it. We generally see this to be &lt;em&gt;nicer&lt;/em&gt; than simply deleting; you don't appear to agree, but this is sort of one of the fundamental things StackExchange does so I'm not sure there's a lot we can do to make you happier about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closed questions below a certain threshold are eventually deleted, but generally we don't manual delete closed questions because they serve as signposts and precedent for what is or isn't considered on-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Likewise, frivolous and/or excessive moderation just needs to be&#xA;  (re)defined. A user that flags a question for editing, rather than&#xA;  make the edit that they are (overly)qualified to make themselves,&#xA;  should lose &quot;moderation points&quot; to encourage them to &quot;get dirty&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't agree with this because this seems to say that the only way to &quot;be helpful&quot; is to complete edit the question. It excludes the possibility for a graduated continuum of &quot;helpfulness&quot; that a user can exist on based on their current ability to commit time to the problem, comfort level with the topic at hand, or mood for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Does a second moderator really need to be notified and manually come&#xA;  in after XX days/months to re-moderate it? Why is one moderator not&#xA;  enough?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what specific instance you are referring to here, but generally this only happens if things get out of hand &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; if somebody has flagged something. It's usually flags that draw my attention to old questions, for example, or some similar activity that bumps the question up to the front page of the active questions list. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If our true purpose is to answer questions and not just to sort them,&#xA;  we're only being about 50% efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That isn't the purpose of this site at all. It is to provide a collection of a &lt;em&gt;certain kind&lt;/em&gt; of questions and their &lt;em&gt;objective answers&lt;/em&gt;. This necessarily involves a process of &quot;sorting&quot; out the questions that are not of the correct kind (as defined by some combination of the overall StackExchange philosophy and the community consensus on meta).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.487" LastActivityDate="2015-02-12T05:15:27.720" CommentCount="0" />

So there's no basis for banning it here on the grounds of &quot;it's covered elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The crux of the issue, then, is: does it harm this site? I don't see any hard evidence as such in your post. Only opinion and conjecture. I'm therefore not particularly inclined to agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You say that the main reason you think modding should be off-topic is that the audience isn't there or isn't suitable to answer the questions. But of the 100 or so modding questions we have, approximately 80% have at least one answer. That doesn't seem like an unhealthy metric to me. Further, &quot;audience size&quot; isn't a good reason for banning a topic anyway; a small audience for a subject is rather an opportunity for the site to &lt;em&gt;attract more users&lt;/em&gt;. We don't want the user base of the site to become stagnant or to get too much of an &quot;in-crowd club&quot; appearance, and supporting a diverse range of topics is therefore ideal, even if the practical audience for those topics is not currently large. We also expect and desire users with lots of different areas of expertise; not all users may have familiarity with all mod tools, but not all users have familiarity with all graphics or physics APIs either (and so on). There's absolutely nothing wrong with having pockets of non-intersecting expertise on the site. It is, in fact, desirable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your arguments regarding culture seem mainly to do with terminology, which is already an issue within the realm of game development and is easily handled by asking clarifying questions to provide specificity in the use of terms that may have different meanings in different contexts. The relatively slow growth of modding-related questions and users focused solely on answering those questions doesn't cause me any concern that there will be a sudden significant shift in jargon on the site that will create a Tower of Babel effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are welcome (and encouraged) to start a game mods proposal on Area 51.

I believe application of the relevant tags &lt;code&gt;mmo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rpg&lt;/code&gt; will appropriately organize the question for searches and for categorization into domain expertise, and there is no need for us to generate or maintain the full set of pairwise permutations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is true that there are subsets of the discipline of producing an MMORPG verus and MMOFPS that may be &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; to that particular genre category, but I don't believe the breadth of that specific area is large enough to justify an entirely unique tag. Rather, the question itself should call out it's specific nature and that should be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By creating tags specifically for each of these sub-genres, I also think we impair their visibility, as users who consider themselves domain experts in the &quot;MMO&quot; area or the &quot;FPS&quot; area may not see questions that they would &lt;em&gt;otherwise&lt;/em&gt; be able to provide useful input on. It similarly further reduces the chance for an asker to miscategorize their question as an &lt;code&gt;mmorts&lt;/code&gt; question (because that's what they think they are building) when the actual question is really more to do with RTS mechanics in general or large-scale network synchronization, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, this fits our already established precedent of avoiding combination tags, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1958/split-2d-physics-into-2d-and-physics&quot;&gt;as we chose to do with &lt;code&gt;2d-physics&lt;/code&gt; recently&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags should be about aiding, searchability, they should not (and cannot reasonably) be able encoding every detail of a question.

They both, obviously, did not work out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like Lasse commented on Almo's answer (which I am mostly agreement with), I find it distracting and tedious to have to monitor both on- and off- topic chat rooms (even as a user, forgetting for my moment my obligation to do so as a moderator). In my experience they never work out well, because people tend to clump up in the more social-oriented rooms (people being social creatures for the most part), and that's where the people are so that's where the discussions end up happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I am not in favor of splitting the site's chat room, preferring instead that we adopt a model whereby on-topic conversation should in general take priority over off-topic banter. I'd rather we strengthen and elevate the level of discourse in our existing room rather than fracture the reasonably-small chat community further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time I recognize there is a need for people to create side-rooms for the purpose of specific, directed discussion for some length of time. I'm not opposed to doing so, provided that those rooms aren't named in a way that might suggest they're official site rooms; after discussion with some fellow moderators I think the best way to do this is for such rooms to named something like &quot;'s Pathfinding Chat&quot; or whatnot (the key aspect being the inclusion of the username, which mirrors the functionality provided by the chat system for 1:1 rooms and comment imports).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastActivityDate="2015-10-10T20:25:36.693" CommentCount="0" />

I've not been here actively for quite a while (just in and out as an observer sometimes), but your chat room seems to be pretty similar to ours: similar levels of activity and chat regulars, and a generally sociable atmosphere which ebbs and flows between being on- and off-topic with priority given to on-topic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know your exact situation, but given the similarities I might be able to offer some insight and suggestions. I've read this meta, and the attached chat. I note Alec's complaint that the room is very casual, and that there are large amounts of time devoted to topics he's (she's?) unhappy with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we're discussing the matter of chat's casualness, I need to bring up that chat was created to be a &quot;third place&quot; (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/do-trilogy-sites-need-a-third-place/&quot;&gt;the SE blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;). Third places are those places away from home or work we congregate and socialise, and among their hallmarks is that &lt;strong&gt;the mood is playful&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The tone of conversation in third places are never marked with tension or hostility. Instead, they have a playful nature, where witty conversation and frivolous banter are not only common, but highly valued. &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chats are always going to be casual and social because it's what we're in chat &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're also here because we like game development, so that's always going to be one of the fun topics. That means an &quot;off topic&quot; room is not going to be very good at staying that way. It's always going to drift back on topic, and probably just look exactly like what your main chat looks like now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which means other rooms are just going to be... other rooms. And actually that seems to be our answer here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;On creating extra rooms to facilitate whatever people need&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've gotten pretty good at this on RPG Chat. I'll share what we do about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Primarily we talk in &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11/rpg-general-chat&quot;&gt;RPG General Chat&lt;/a&gt;. This place looks pretty much like your main chat room: we socialise, go on- or off-topic, discuss advanced or simple stuff, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We try to keep General Chat a safe place where anyone can join in. To those ends we created &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/13848/not-a-bar-but-plays-one-on-tv&quot;&gt;Not A Bar&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/13848?m=22907399#22907399&quot;&gt;the name's a joke&lt;/a&gt;). It's our pressure valve for unpleasant conversations and arguments. Those get moved there wholesale from General Chat when it's called for. It also makes for a pretty good side-conversation room when General Chat's busy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also have some purpose-built rooms that just naturally emerged and may fade out of use later: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25090/the-campfire&quot;&gt;The Campfire&lt;/a&gt; is where we share stories about our tabletop sessions. It started a few weeks ago to do just that while General Chat was busy, and has stuck around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/29755/genesis&quot;&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; is where we do random character generation, usually for fun. We created it recently once we started doing a whole lot of that in Not A Bar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Before that we were using &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/15558/2015/7/1&quot;&gt;a room just for deadEarth&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the worst designed RPGs ever, and on top of that offensive in most ways: sexist, homophobic, racist, you name it. (So, &lt;strong&gt;trigger warning&lt;/strong&gt;, the material we quote from it might offend.) Characters are extremely likely to come out of character creation &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/15558?m=16443850#16443850&quot;&gt;crippled, dying, or already dead&lt;/a&gt;, but that also makes character creation amusing and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/15558?m=19205185#19205185&quot;&gt;strangely relaxing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some users also have their very own rooms we've taken to calling spoil-lairs, which they'll use to plan their upcoming RPG sessions so that their fellow players (who are also in chat) don't see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so on. The list has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;This is what it sounds like you need to be doing.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might need a professional version of Not A Bar: a pressure-valve side-room where people can go to discuss advanced topics while Main Chat's busy. Main Chat can't do all things, and it will always be a social place. You might want an AI Guild room, or an AI Chat, or a Super Advanced Stuff chat, or a Super Basics chat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might want a &quot;move it when someone asks&quot; rule, you might not. (Our General Chat upholds a general rule that anyone can ping the room's owner and request a conversation be moved to Not A Bar, and it'll be moved. This has only ever been invoked for conversations that were genuinely unpleasant for that person: it's &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; overstaying its welcome. We've only had to do this a few times, so your mileage may vary.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may want to just create chats about topics as they're needed. Is someone busy talking about pointers in the main room, but you want to talk about advanced physics for in-motion collision detection of soft bodies? Create a room, link it in main chat (if you paste just the URL, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/24703908#24703908&quot;&gt;it oneboxes all fancy-like&lt;/a&gt;). If you find you're needing to talk about advanced mathematics often, maybe it's worth having an advanced mathematics room to be available while main chat's busy, or to just be the go-to place for that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need a place where &quot;people know their stuff&quot; (quoting that &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/29410/conversation/rationale-for-chat-split&quot;&gt;rationale conversation&lt;/a&gt;), it'll come about one of these ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2698" LastEditorUserId="2698" LastEditDate="2015-10-14T15:54:59.380" LastActivityDate="2015-10-14T15:54:59.380" CommentCount="3" />

The idea that SE is not a forum or a tutoring site is fine, but it can also be rather dismissive and discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular case I would suggest the question be put on hold, request that the user refrain from making further edits for now and offer some avenue of assisting them, either by asking probing questions in the comments or referring/inviting them to the chat rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/254205/opt-in-mentor-privilege-at-7-5k&quot;&gt;mentor system&lt;/a&gt; would be a welcome addition to SE for this type of situation, both for orientation with how SE works and to assist with specific problem domains.

This is because the StackExchange network is not a discussion forum, it's a network of sites dedicated to provided &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; answers to questions (with some minor exceptions for some sites devoted to more &quot;softer&quot; domains).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, after looking at a question and verifying that the question is at least in some form related to game development, you then check the question for criteria that would disqualify it from the site:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;is it asking &quot;what should I learn&quot; or &quot;how should I start making games&quot; or &quot;which technology should I use for this problem?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;is it an open-ended discussion that will primarily generate responses that are the thoughts or opinions of the answerers (as opposed to statements that can be backed up by facts)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and so on&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's why the help center presents it's information in the order it does: first it tells you &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;what the subject domain is&lt;/a&gt; and then it tells you &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&quot;&gt;what disqualifies a question&lt;/a&gt; (even if it passes the first set of criteria).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Some amount of subjectivity is allowed&lt;/a&gt;, because as you noted in your linked question, game design is not an absolute science. But we're still a site on the StackExchange network and so we still expect questions to have some level of objectivity to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your specific questions, there are a few key points that render it off-topic in the form it is currently (or was when I closed it):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I need a tip...&quot; is generally a preface that suggests the question is too broad. It usually means the question is going to end up polling for ideas from the userbase, and poll-type questions (which are asking &quot;what do you think&quot; or otherwise forming a list of items of equal or indeterminate value) are off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You go on to use qualifications like &quot;good balance,&quot; &quot;mobile-device-friendliness,&quot; and &quot;pain in the ass,&quot; to frame your request. All of those are &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; subjective criteria. You further assert that &quot;suggestions&quot; are acceptable (suggestions are generally not objective answers).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this makes the question you posed more a subject for discussion and debate -- an interesting discussion and debate, I'm sure, but not a debate that fits well within StackExchange's guidelines (or indeed, the technical workings of its software).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your question meets the basic initial criteria being on GDSE (it's about games), but it almost meets a lot of the later criteria that subsequently disqualify it.

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool game development related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;scripts packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;project or blogs from notable or just community devs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

There are answers that are (attempts at) humour, and there are answers that address the question.

An answer that tries to address a question but &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; an incidental joke within it is very different from an answer that &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; only a joke - for the only sake of being funny.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first case should be allowed because of the obvious reason that the primary function of an answer is trying to answer, no matter if it uses an academic, an informal or a funny tone. However, the second case should not be allowed simply because, well, if it's not even trying to answer, then it's not an answer (an example of a fairly hilarious answer like that is the following: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/112272/how-can-i-create-borders-in-an-open-world-game-that-dont-feel-artificial/112293#112293&quot;&gt;How can I create borders in an open-world game that don&amp;#39;t feel artificial?&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;It's subjective. But just as always&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, in practice the boundary that separates answers with jokes from joke-answers can become less clear. However, it is just as subjective as the similar decisions that are enacted when questions are flagged as &quot;too broad&quot; or when someone thinks a given answer looks more like a comment and then flags it as &quot;it's not an answer&quot;. When it happens, a decision has to be made on whether in fact the answer was just a comment (i.e. related to the original question, but not trying to answer it). I don't see why that is so different from the case where jokes were what motivated the flagging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, one person deciding that is always a hard call. There is where the voting system for deleting answers would theoretically work the best, since multiple people summing up their interpretations about a given answer being or not an answer (due to whatever the reason) is always the ideal due to the highly subjective nature of the decision. However, the problem is two-folded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In practice, moderators are the only barrier against joke-answers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @JoshPetrie has brought to my attention in the comments (I admitedly forgot that), only answers scored -1 or less can be voted for deletion. Considering that funny answers tend to be often upvoted, that alone puts them more often than not, outside the helm of possibly being voted for deletion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that barrier was not enough, we have to also recall that only users with at least 20K can vote for deletion. It means that in the rare event of a joke answer to have negative scores for long enough to be voted for deletion, even then, considering that gamedev.stackexchange currently has only 10 members with such rep (two of them are the moderators) and not all are necessarily active in reviewing tasks, that additional barrier to delete joke answers makes it virtually impossible that any joke answers ever get deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would open up a risky possibility. Therefore, it seems that in the vast majority of the cases, the moderators themselves are the only option for not letting a joke answer endure. In such a case, I sustain that yes, the moderators should have to make such decision when joke answers get flagged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to sum up, as I argued above, the minimum criteria for it should be the same used in all other cases of &quot;not an answer&quot; flagging. I.e. deciding whether the answer &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; tries to usefully answer the original question, despite of the joke it carries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="72423" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.557" LastActivityDate="2016-01-16T03:55:53.047" CommentCount="5" />

I tend to agree. I  tend to think that &quot;low-effort&quot; or &quot;zero-effort&quot; questions should not be closed down, but just down-voted. However, I would like us to have a clearer definition on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specially, because the issue at hand seems to be quite controversial in many of the sister sites (and I don't think it's different in our case). Different positions can be found in discussions on the subject that were already held in sister sites. Se for instance the debates on Meta.Stackexchange and Meta.Stackoverflow: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107999/how-to-best-handle-no-effort-questions&quot;&gt;How to best handle no effort questions?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/260828/do-we-need-a-close-reason-for-zero-effort-questions&quot;&gt;Do we need a close reason for zero-effort questions?&lt;/a&gt;.

We expect users to search this site for existing questions before asking and close duplicates, so it doesn't seem unduly onerous to ask them to at least skim a Google search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an absurd example, if someone systematically worked their way through the Unity API, asking &quot;what does the gameObject.AddComponent method do?&quot; &quot;What about gameObject.BroadcastMessage?&quot; - technically each of those is a question about game development with a concise correct answer, so although trivial they could be on-topic. But it seems silly for StackExchange to mirror the contents of an existing official API documentation. (Which will generally/hopefully be kept up to date better than SE answers)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the scale of that example is absurd, I think &quot;How do I use GPS location in Unity&quot; is this kind of question that amounts to duplicating the manual - searching the API for &quot;gps&quot; or &quot;location&quot; both turn up &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/30_search.html?q=gps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a useful result at the top of the list&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Then again, making &quot;how do I get started/which technology&quot; questions off-topic hasn't exactly stemmed the flow of those questions either.

But that's different from questions that show absolutely zero research effort (or rather, the two concepts are orthogonal). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure it's possible to set a broad policy on this, as I think the issue will come down to the kinds of analysis of the question that's best done on a case-by-case basis. For example, in the case of the GPS question, there's two ways we could interpret the question as written:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;How do I access the GPS in Unity?&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This form of the question is asking us to plug &quot;access GPS unity&quot; into Google or whatever on behalf of the OP.

To me, this question appears off topic, and mildly counter-productive to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming from Arqade, we tend to auto-close anything asking for developer intent. This reason is often disputed; Developer intent often requires a sense of speculation, given that we generally can not directly ask the developers, themselves. In some cases, the questions are met with actual reference to cases where the developers were asked identical questions. Given the answer is thus available, the question usually survives; but not without edit to remove the request for developer intent. I.E. Dev. intent in the question would be removed, but providing dev. intent in the answer is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of game developing, using the original code or method to replicate the intended behaviour may constitute breaking copyright. You can get away with cloning a game if you figure it out independently, but directly attempting to copy a games code or method can often lead to severe penalty. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My stance on the subject is that we should help the user figure it out, but not by telling them how the original did so, so they may simply copy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However; None of the close votes appear to adequately match any viable reason to close the question.

This is meant for questions that will incite arguments, polls or extended discussion. This is not the same as merely not being useful or interesting. &quot;Opinion-based&quot; is specifically defined in this context as likely to &lt;em&gt;solicit argument&lt;/em&gt;.

When the asker is soliciting advice on books to use, courses to take, languages to pick, what to study, how to study, didactical processes or progressions... all of those are &quot;how to get started / what technology to use&quot; questions and are appropriate to close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A question is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, per se, a &quot;how to get started&quot; question if &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/revisions/116594/1&quot;&gt;it includes the words &quot;how do I get started,&quot; &quot;where to begin&quot; or similar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/117848/how-can-i-describe-a-square-in-opengl-es-2-0&quot;&gt;it is a very simple problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/review/close/54507&quot;&gt;it has more than one reasonable, well-scoped answers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/117511/moving-a-ball-left-right-or-up-depending-on-where-the-screen-is-tapped&quot;&gt;it is asked by an inexperienced user&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/117083/best-practice-to-store-level-data-in-a-rhythm-based-game&quot;&gt;it is a difficult problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that if you can vote to close, you are also capable of editing questions, and you should probably &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; making those edits to closure.

I've gone through some life changes since I first got on this site 5 years ago. I've realised the real value of kindness, and I remember a certain senior player on the site who made life hell for me when I started out here (who is happily no longer around). I also remember a phase where I made life hell for some folks; I was dealing with my own issues then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that this is a gaming-related site and gaming has a whole set of stigmas around it: competitiveness, rampant bravado, intellectual duelling, etc. etc. I'm not boxing this site as being only those things, but they sometimes come through. Some apply to programming more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we have to criticise new users into hiding, and downvote their humble attempts at answers over the most trivial things, putting them on -1 before they can even think, or for things that are just unreasonable?&lt;/strong&gt; We all know how the -1 dynamic works; once you hit -1, chances of getting any upvotes are pretty much annulled. That should be saved for worst cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't like this kind of thing when I see high-ranked members doing it, members with a vested interest in this site. I'm in my late thirties now, and I try to accept that I'm not one of the younger folk anymore, and I'm not new to my field, either. I have knowledge to impart, and with that seniority comes a &lt;strong&gt;duty&lt;/strong&gt; to be kind to those less knowledgable and reputable... and often younger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One must appreciate that tearing up and throwing out the window what people have put time and effort into crafting - their answers - is a slap in the face and gives you and the rest of us high-ranked users, a bad name... Why? Because that's the nature of privilege. I have had hateful comments directed at me before on this site due to my perceived privilege, undeserved. We are grouped that way in the newcomers mind... as top-rankers. In spite of the fact that the vast majority of the top members on this site are peaceful and at ease in their position - just as they should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's not be stackoverflow. We're a smaller community with far greater control over how we treat newcomers. We set the tone. It's one thing when we old hands duel amongst one another... quite another to pick on a greenhorn.

True, that content is tied to a person and the effect of voting on that content is reflected in a number on that person's profile. Ultimately, however, I think the more important goal for the site is the curation of good content, and that that goal takes priority -- even if by just a hair -- over concerns about the psychological impact a negative score or minor dip in one's reputation will have on a user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is not to say, however, that entirely disregarding the person on the other end of the post is acceptable. Good content doesn't happen without good users, and I think it's true that we could all spend a little more time to take a look at the history of a user we're about to down vote, and if that user seems new or inexperienced, maybe think a little harder about leaving an explanatory comment as well to help the user learn.

This creates good duplication targets, it creates good, all-in-one-place threads for search engines to index, and it provides a compelling benefit for users to post new answers addressing the problem in other specific tools, if so desired. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/118862/how-do-i-trigger-code-just-once&quot;&gt;How can I trigger code once&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of that sort of question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, though, we shouldn't be overzealous in generalizing questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the specific text of a question reveals the problem is really related to bugfixing/tweaking some problem specific to the implementation of the general task in some specific tool, we shouldn't attempt to generalize that away.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example if the question in the original post were asking something more specific, such as &quot;what knob do I need to twiddle to make the afterimage sprites fade out over time,&quot; that's not something I think we can turn into a general question, so this isn't a blanket rule. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary:&#xA;If the user &lt;em&gt;doesn't know&lt;/em&gt; how to perform the task at all, the question is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; suitable to be made as general as possible (although answers can be tool-specific). If user &lt;em&gt;does know&lt;/em&gt; how to do the task, but is having a specific problem with it (possibly as relates to a specific tool/engine), it probably shouldn't be generalized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the long run I think more general, canonical questions are better for the health of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.557" LastActivityDate="2016-03-25T17:57:47.513" CommentCount="1" />

Often times that subjectivity is either discussion-based (which has no place on an SE site) or highly-contextual. The latter &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be appropriate here and could be a strong contender for &quot;good subjective,&quot; but that context needs to be specified or the question falls back into the extremely broad, discussion-oriented kind of query that's a better fit for a forum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;to the detriment of the site&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's one think to not &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; that we close a lot of subjective questions. It's another to assert that doing so is damaging the site in some way. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm also not seeing any &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; for such a claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying high vote-count makes a question good for the site, but&#xA;  it's a helpful filter to find some questions where one might dispute&#xA;  their being closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's good, because vote count is definitely not a metric. Consider also that many of those questions are &lt;em&gt;very, very&lt;/em&gt; old relative to the site's total lifespan. That both means they've had much more time to accumulate votes and also that they come from an era of the site when it's focused was being defined. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, the number of concrete times somebody has actually attempted to bring up any of those questions for re-opening? If you include your post as such an endorsement, I can probably count those occurrences on two hands instead of one. But generally it doesn't happen that often. There aren't any pending re-open votes on any of those questions and they are very rarely referenced in meta topics like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Good games to earn your wings is, while broad on the surface,&#xA;  something that a lot of experienced developers talk about when giving&#xA;  advice to those who want to learn to make games. The answers there,&#xA;  while broad, are an asset to this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can make a pretty strong argument for most closed questions that the answers are an asset to the site. That's not what the site exists for, though. It is not trying to be all things to all people, not trying to be the one-stop resource for all game development questions. It's trying to be a very specific thing, focusing on specific and mostly-objective (ideally canonical) questions with similarly-described answers. There are plenty of other excellent sites for discussion and broader &quot;theory crafting,&quot; for lack of a better term, within games, and we aren't trying to replace those. Indeed, we often try to direct people there when their needs are pretty obviously at odds with what this site provides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How to prevent 'too awesome to use' syndrome is a good game-design&#xA;  question, and good answers have been given to it. It was closed for&#xA;  being primarily opinion-based...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't remember closing that, to be honest, but re-reading it now I probably still would. I think the issue with the question is, as I've noted before, a lack of appropriate contextual scope. It's presented as a question about a mechanical aspect of game design without any sort of scoping through a genre, through the specification of additional extra mechanics, and so on. I think that makes it too broad (so I concede that 'opinion-based' is not what I would use to close it today). But that was two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Does the existence of helpful and yet more subjective stack exchanges&#xA;  + the existence of helpful and yet closed game design questions on this exchange perhaps suggest we should open the doors to less&#xA;  objectively answerable questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Potentially. But how would you do that? What is your proposal for &quot;opening the doors,&quot; exactly? I don't mean to be harsh, or to pick on you specifically, but but when you want to change a policy you should probably have some kind of idea &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you want that change to look like in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I look at these questions and I look for things that give the question a lot of context. Ones that put the question in a framework defined by the &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; being &lt;em&gt;developed&lt;/em&gt;. Questions that provide enough of such context, I think they make &quot;good subjective&quot; questions. Questions that don't, I think they make &quot;bad subjective&quot; questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastActivityDate="2016-05-02T18:03:19.117" CommentCount="6" />

Each of your original four main questions could be a question on its own, and in your subsequent paragraphs you often pose one or two more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're asking us to see the future. &quot;Will this bite me later?&quot; for example, is not something we can objectively answer in a way that improves the site's index of knowledge for posterity (we can only really say &quot;maybe, maybe not&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't scope the questions well.

Much greater revision occurred in the earlier 4.6 release, and evidence shows that substantial updates still occur during sub-version releases. Differentiating between pre-Unity 5 and post-Unity 5 does necessarily help us identify the exact version the user is asking about, nor how their version might impact on the context of their question, as opposed to the assumed &quot;latest version&quot; if the user does not specify either way. It is therefore more helpful for the user to mention &quot;I am using Unity build x.y.z&quot; as opposed to tagging the question as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity5&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity5&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Analysis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity5&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity5&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity5&lt;/a&gt; tag&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking over &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/tags/unity5/topusers&quot; title=&quot;Tags: Unity5: Top Users @ Game.Dev&quot;&gt;some of the numbers associated with the tag&lt;/a&gt;, I can see that more than half of the questions also use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity&lt;/a&gt; tag. I personally find myself adding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity&lt;/a&gt; tag to questions during edits, if I identify the context to be non-exclusive to Unity 5.

In some cases, the asker acknowledges that they are using Unity 5, but ask a question that deals with more general concepts or implementations. Questions such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/129799/how-to-offset-a-2d-gameobject-by-a-pixel-amount&quot;&gt;'How do I provide a pixel offset?'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/129663/how-to-change-position-of-a-gameobject-from-another-gameobjects-script&quot;&gt;'How do I change a game objects position from another game object?'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; deal with basic Unity concepts, that would easily apply to earlier versions of the editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are questions that deliberately target Unity 5, though as they currently stand, may not need to. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/129656/impossible-rooms-and-5d-space&quot;&gt;&quot;Impossible rooms and 5D space&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; specifically targets Unity 5, but in context, deals with a much more general subject. For what little the current answers actually answer the Unity part of the question, the general response is that &lt;em&gt;'Unity can not do it like they could do it, you will have to cheat a little'&lt;/em&gt;. The suggested &quot;cheats&quot; are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Unity 5 exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In most questions, I only presume the tag is being used to infer that the user is using Unity 5. Questions like *&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/129573/how-to-automatically-delete-an-object-in-unity&quot;&gt;&quot;How to automatically delete an object&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/129410/cant-get-my-android-device-to-be-connected-to-my-game-via-unity-remote5&quot;&gt;&quot;Can't get my android device to be connected..&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; presumably only use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity5&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity5&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity5&lt;/a&gt; tag because the user is using the latest version of Unity. They do not actually specify anything in regards to the version they are using, but the context is also that which is not unique to Unity 5. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;In regards to the potential increase in duplicates&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the issue of the few instances where version difference &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a large impact on the context of the answer. I am yet to find an obvious example for Unity 5, but I am sure there are some there. Further questions using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity&lt;/a&gt; tag would suffer the same penalty from earlier versions, it is simply clear that nobody has thought to include a version tag until Unity 5.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of managing duplicates, we could then go in one of two directions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duplicate questions are not duplicates if concerning different versions&lt;/strong&gt; might be preferred, by some, but I generally disagree. Users may &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the version difference would make their question unique, where the context of their question does not change dramatically enough between the two versions to warrant an alternate answer. This leads to multiple questions that don't really need to be in multiple, and it would take more moderation (and moderation specifically from users savvy with Unity and its version differences) to clean up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User should mention versions, but alternate answers specific to alternate versions should be encouraged&lt;/strong&gt; is my personal preference. By encouraging alternate answers for alternate versions under the same answer, we encourage all relevant information in the one place, without further duplication. While I can see this having its flaws, I do not think it would come with any problems not already present with the global issue that a lot of our answers are inevitably going to be outdated, and require updating.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; case where I perform an edit on a Unity question, I go over the question, and look at the tags. I ask myself &quot;does this apply to Unity pre-5? does this apply to Unity 5?&quot;, and as far as I can remember, this has always led to me ensuring that both tags were included. As far as I am aware, these tag inclusions have never been rejected or reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wouldn't it be better to simply merge &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity5&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity5&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity5&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; &#xA;We could employ a suggestion that users mention the exact version they are using, for clarity. By having a single tag, we do not infer that users should only differentiate their questions between older versions&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the current version.

That said, if users are completely unfamiliar with the term, we probably should not expect them to be using any variation. On the flip side, as we see questions that fit this tag, we should be adding the tag. As users notice the new tag, those that are unfamiliar with the acronym &quot;&lt;em&gt;pbr&lt;/em&gt;&quot; would hopefully look to the user guidance, and familiarise themselves with its use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;pbr&lt;/em&gt; is not search friendly, but than, main tags do not need to be. If we implement alternate &lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;, the alternate tags will still come up when a user searches. We can thus implement one or two alternate tags (I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/physically-based-render&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;physically-based-render&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;physically-based-render&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/physical-based-rendering&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;physical-based-rendering&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;physical-based-rendering&lt;/a&gt;) to further facilitate potential user searches.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Regarding universally accepted terminology, as says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;our almighty overlord&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.au/search?q=physically%20based%20rendering&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;&amp;#39;physically based rendering&amp;#39; @ google.com&quot;&gt;a quick google search for &lt;em&gt;physically based rendering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I find that &quot;&lt;em&gt;pbr&lt;/em&gt;&quot; is a common acronym.

A user voted to close the question as the context was generic programming, and commented on an answer telling the user not to answer such questions. Ultimately, the asker &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; the problem actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; specific to game developing, which in turn is adding to confusion. In the example, for instance, the user refers to a generic constructor problem as a &quot;Unity error&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously, I have noticed that 'generic' issues encountered during Game Developing do not receive close-vote attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I frequently run into similar examples that are left open, answered, and upvoted. The clear difference is that it takes the effort of attempting to answer the question (or rather, solve the askers problem) to reveal the generic nature of the actual problem. Previously not giving it as much thought, I am sure some of my own answers simply address generic issues, and have nevertheless been accepted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples I have seen include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Explaining that &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt; is different to &lt;code&gt;Variable&lt;/code&gt;.

That said, your best course of action is to edit the original question, and let others decide whether it should be reopened.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you wish to make your case for reopening the question, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do better than 'there is good information available that I think would be helpful'. You specifically need to address the core close reasons, and more specifically, address how you could &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; the question to limit these reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that in opening or closing a question, we generally do not address any current or potential answers. That is; arguments based off answers are invalid for closing or opening a question. I personally find that answers can give us &lt;em&gt;insight&lt;/em&gt; into how others &lt;em&gt;interpret&lt;/em&gt; the question, but if you comment that &quot;this question should be opened, because the answer is really helpful&quot;, it's just not going to happen. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost, you should never ask a new question if you already identify it as a duplicate of a previous question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But what if the original question was closed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it was closed, your identical question will probably be closed for the same reasons. In this case I think there is more to it than that, but I will talk more about that, below. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you instead &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; the original question to better suit site policy, you will not necessarily see the question reopened. The edit will flag the question for the &quot;Vote to Reopen&quot; queue, and other members will have an opportunity to vote towards reopening the question. Keep in mind that once opened, further users may still vote to close the question, again. If you truly believe the question is on topic for current site policy, make an argument about it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But what if I think the current answers are wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think the current answers are wrong, down-vote them. If you really wish to be helpful, add a helpful comment explaining what you find to be wrong. You can add your own answer, and if your answer truly shines above the rest, it will eventually be up voted above the rest. &lt;em&gt;If you do not have an answer, but still believe the other answers to be incorrect or of low quality&lt;/em&gt;, post a bounty. These options are all available if and when the question is reopened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But what if the question is not reopened?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question is not reopened, that infers that the community in general does not see this question as being on topic. You can ask about it more specifically, here in meta, and perhaps other users will provide more helpful dialogue on why the question is not a good fit for here. Ultimately, if it comes to this, any identical question you post will meet with quick closure and potential down voting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But what if it really IS a good question?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because a question is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;potentially helpful&lt;/em&gt;, does not mean it is a good fit for StackExchange. Good examples can be seen in primarily opinion-based questions. Other elements to the question might make it a poor fit for this sort of site, and ultimately make it far too difficult to uphold the general quality we strive for. I will talk more about why I think this is one of those questions, below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In regards to the question in context, I would personally still vote to close. As well as being &quot;Not Constructive&quot;, I can see this question being &quot;Too Broad&quot;, &quot;Primarily Opinion Based&quot; and even &quot;Unclear&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question &quot;What are the basic game activities&quot; is currently closed as &quot;Not Constructive&quot;. I do not believe we close questions for this reason, any more. That said, &lt;em&gt;if we do&lt;/em&gt;, that is the penultimate argument. This question has already been closed, and will surely be closed again. One of the users who voted on this question is now a mod&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and if they agree the question is still off-topic, they do not require any more votes to close the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the current close status of the question, the major issue I see is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;broadness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. What do you mean by &quot;game activities&quot;, exactly? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interpret it as &quot;what can we tell the player to do&quot;. If we stick to the basics, this question is not very broad, at all. At least, not from my opinion. One constant in my studies has been that, when it comes down to it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.canvas.net/courses/3/pages/level-3-dot-1-2-objectives-goals&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;we can only really give the user 8 different core objectives&lt;/a&gt;. That said, I am sure others would disagree, entirely. That is their &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt;. If an answer relies to heavily on a users &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt;, that might also make the question &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;primarily opinion-based&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is another sort of question we don't accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first answer interprets the question as specifically asking about the basic activity &lt;em&gt;for each genre in existence&lt;/em&gt;. With 4 up-votes and no down-votes, I think it is clear that others have shared this interpretation. This particular answer &lt;em&gt;screams&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;too broad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A complete answer would have to include &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; game genre - well outside the scope of the format of Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second answer appears to interpret the question as specifically asking about &lt;em&gt;aesthetics&lt;/em&gt;. I am personally unsure how the user could have made that interpretation, aesthetics and activities are greatly different from each other. All aside, the answer has received almost as much up-votes as the first, despite tackling a completely different question all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear to see that this question received mixed interpretation. I can personally understand why this question is considered &lt;em&gt;not constructive&lt;/em&gt;, and would vote to close this question, myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Forgive me if I miss-inferred; As far as I know, users are listed in order of when they placed their votes, so I infer that Byte56 was not a mod when they cast this particular vote, as the question &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have been automatically closed &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; another user could cast their vote.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63208" LastActivityDate="2016-09-29T02:36:24.427" CommentCount="3" />

That said, I was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/revisions/131300/2&quot;&gt;submit an edit&lt;/a&gt; to a question where I only removed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unityscript&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unityscript&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unityscript&lt;/a&gt; tag&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

As a result, it is entirely possible that the ability to do so comes with the provision of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; privileges, without deliberate mention. If that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the case, this would have to be somewhere between the last privileged &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; unlocked (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/view-close-votes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;View Close Votes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at 250 reputation) and the next privilege &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can unlock (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit Questions and Answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at 2,000 reputation).

We can see this has already happened, here; since my original post, the question I personally down-voted has had one of its up-votes retracted. Another of your questions has received more down-voting, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the result of commenting on the amount of down-votes, I could only see the votes as a form of attitude punishment, which is bad form in its entirity. When these things are brought up, in meta, we have to assume that some users are simply being directed to your questions, agree with the downvotes, but do not agree that they should comment on why they are doing so. I still do not agree with this, but it's better form than criticing the question entirely off perceived attitude. Regardless, we can see that this is somewhat of the case, here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will make comments where I have personally voted, below&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have three questions that I have asked on the main site.

Your telling us that the up-votes come from users specifically because &lt;em&gt;they do not agree that the question should be down-voted&lt;/em&gt;, which itself is a poor voting practice. If you do not agree that a question should be down-voted, &lt;em&gt;you simply don't down-vote it&lt;/em&gt;. You should never award a question with up-votes if you do not think that the question actually deserves up-votes. We also can't tell, now, if &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; thought your question was useful, given that you've told us the up-votes were placed to negate the down-votes.

I did so a mere 2 hours after your final edit, and can recall leaving your question at -5. As such, it appears that even this question has been mostly untouched, since your final edit. Ultimately, I voted that your question was &lt;strong&gt;unclear&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;un-useful&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;If you were to improve the question, you could consider the following:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote you from the comments, &quot;&lt;em&gt;@liggiorgio I'm not actually running this in game maker. Read the post very carefully. This is a mod of a game maker game&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&#xA;I had completely missed that you were not asking about using Game Maker, the first time I read your question. Your telling us that you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it was made in Game Maker 8. That is not helpful, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if it is not important. You say it should not be important, &lt;em&gt;but why do you mention it&lt;/em&gt;? It is good to remember that if the information is not important, it probably should not be there. Useless information can detract from useful information, and make your question look overly cluttered. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your question appears to continue providing unhelpful information further down, where you appear to reprint duplicate code, simply for the point of presenting it in a more readable format. If you think that your code would look better presented in a different format, only present it in the different format. You can still refer to it, earlier, as &quot;code snipper 1&quot; or &quot;my first code, below&quot; or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;If I were to improve the question, I would consider the following:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please take this with a grain of salt, but I would personally delete the question, if it only came down to quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, you were having a problem with a mod created by &lt;em&gt;SomeGuy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. When you have little information about the origin, it makes things particularly difficult. We do not know if &lt;em&gt;SomeGuy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is even remotely good at game developing, so for all we know, your problem could have been any number of inconsistencies resulting from author error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I'm confidant in saying that the only reason this question found an answer was that you were evidently able to find the answer without GameDev.SE. While your answer does point to something &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; in GameMaker (at least, in my opinion), there is simply not enough information in your question to accurately pinpoint the cause without personally playing around with your project. &lt;em&gt;This is still a problem&lt;/em&gt;: How would anybody experiencing the same sort of problems find your question? &lt;em&gt;Not very well&lt;/em&gt;, I would say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, with a vote of -5, your question does not appear to regular users. As such, not many users are actually going to &lt;em&gt;be able&lt;/em&gt; to up-vote. You have to ask whether it is worth cutting you losses. If I am not mistaken, you actually earn a medal for deleting a question with severe down-votes, so it's not all bad!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another option&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you found your answer, so your not worried with attracting more attention to answer your question. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; tailor it to make it easier to find, if &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; users are having the problem. It &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; that the problem &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; related to the mod being made in an earlier version of GameMaker. Why not rewrite the question to focus more on the fact that your importing a model into a GameMaker mod and having said problems?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the looks of the answer, I suspect that your code had &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with it. If that is the case, remove it. All of it. It might seem useful, but it might also detract users who &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; their problem is not a code problem, and immediately assume that yours &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make it short and sweet, and again, focus on the core problem. You might consider making the title more specific, as this is the first thing users will see.

If the original asker decides they are unhappy with your edit, or other users decide your edit is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an improvement, it can easily be reverted; Assuming you did make the edit in good faith, it's no biggie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In situations of blatantly off-topic questions where the user has made an effort in their attempts to ask the question, I would consider making more drastic changes, in an attempt to convert the question to an on-topic question that might still help the original asker. In these situations, I always leave a comment explaining why I made such an edit, detailing how the old question would be closed as off-topic and how the new question should still help the user find the information they were after.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What, if anything, can be done to better align it with GDSE?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the question asks &quot;How can I improve the chances of being approved for Steam Greenlight&quot;. This raises two flags:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, we need to advise the user in &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to get &quot;greenlit&quot;. From what I can tell, this is &lt;em&gt;some sort&lt;/em&gt; of popularity vote. While there is a concencus across multiple articles that popularity &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a big impact on who gets greenlit, there is broad speculation on minor impacts, such as how Steam manages their traffic to your site and how Steam may randomly select games of lesser popularity. Ultimately, your &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt; of the exact conditions in which a game is greenlit goes a long way towards answering &quot;how can I improve the chances of that happening&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Given that we can at least agree that being greenlit is greatly based on popularity, we see that this question effectivley becomes 'how do I make my game more popular', or to a lesser degree, 'how do I make sure my game is good'.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I think it's fair to say that this question is unsuitable for the GDSE, and does not provide room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Well, what can I do, instead? &lt;em&gt;(inferred question)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question should be closed, but if the intention is to help the asker, there is certainly alternatives to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comment on the original question and advise the user to try voicing their question on a relevant forum. Forums are generally far more flexible in their governing rules, and such questions are often welcomed. Furthermore, forums support greater dialog between individuals, which might allow for greater feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comment on the original question, advising the user to try voicing their question in our chat room. This will still require the user to achieve a reputation score of 20 to unlock the &quot;talk in chat&quot; privilege, but I think it's fair to expect at least a little effort on the asker's behalf.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While I do not agree with the inclusion of the asker's Greenlight page, as it only serves the purpose of advertisement, there is nothing stopping you from visiting the user's page and checking it out.

I can see several reasons; I will go in to them in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you do not feel comfortable with it, &lt;em&gt;do not do it&lt;/em&gt;.

If an image has been posted, I would assume that user has appropriate permission to do so. Furthermore, when we post content to StackExchange, we are stating that we have the right to do so. In fact, when we submit content, we grant ownership to StackExchange&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/137714/please-negotiate-and-make-obvious-user-favorable-license-terms-for-uploaded-imag&quot; title=&quot;Please negotiate and make obvious user-favorable license terms for uploaded images @ meta.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;According to a moderators reply on a related question,&lt;/a&gt; images are no different; and in situations where the user &lt;em&gt;can not&lt;/em&gt; grant rights to StackExchange, I would not think they had the appropriate rights to &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; the image, in the first place. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; we be alerted to a breach, all we really need to do is comply with the image removal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Fair Use&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this aside, there is also the principle of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Fair_use_on_the_Internet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Fair Use: Fair Use on the Internet @ en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;fair use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In most cases, I would assume the image was being used in conjunction with a reasonable interpretation of &quot;fair use&quot; - especially when most of the images I intercept are tailor made, and only include fragments of copyrighted material&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the point of demonstration. It is important to note that &lt;em&gt;I am not a lawyer&lt;/em&gt;; If you wish to know more about fair use, I would direct any questions towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.stackexchange.com/&quot; title=&quot;law.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Law.SE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think context is important, here. The post you link to is on the &lt;em&gt;photography&lt;/em&gt; stack exchange. The replies are all from users who have seasoned reputation in &lt;em&gt;photography&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;in comparisson&lt;/em&gt;, not much else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it fairly obvious that in the context of photography, image licensing is far more important. Users are asking about &lt;em&gt;photography&lt;/em&gt;, and are therefore posting examples of &lt;em&gt;photography&lt;/em&gt;. This would be like someone asking about their game, &lt;em&gt;and posting the entire game project&lt;/em&gt;. As previously mentioned, the context in which we commonly use images is not as critical, in comparison. We are far less likely to &lt;em&gt;encounter&lt;/em&gt; a situation where an image poses a risk of breaking license.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an additional comment, the answer you specifically link to asserts that '(Moderators)&lt;em&gt;policing&lt;/em&gt; copyright; that's not StackExchange's policy.', and issues concerning copyright are a greater issue in &lt;em&gt;protection&lt;/em&gt; of our own user's work. While I do not necessarily agree with this, this highlights the relevance of context, in relation to the actual community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Correcting image links is an appropriate edit; but make sure &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; know that your making an improvement, too.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, your edits go towards future-proofing the question. These are the sort of edits we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, it is definitely worth addressing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you made the change, as a comment. Some users simply would not know that we prefer images to be uploaded in a specific way, &lt;em&gt;and why&lt;/em&gt;. I personally did not know that &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; uploaded images were uploaded to a 'StackExchange account' until I raised the potential issue of answering a question &lt;em&gt;in the form of a picture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Other elements to consider, when improving an image.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will personally make and approve edits that convert the image to the &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; account. I should point out that a link update is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; not the only improvement that can be made to &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; image links. Initially (and most of the time, indefinitely), a properly used link should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xA;&#xA;    [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Z2Gi.png&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notice the text &quot;&lt;code&gt;enter image description here&lt;/code&gt;&quot;? This is the &lt;em&gt;alternate text&lt;/em&gt;. If a user is unable to load the image, the alternate text should take its place. As such, you should include an 'alternate text caption' as an &lt;em&gt;alternate&lt;/em&gt; to the image. This caption should clearly convey the same intention as the image, but in text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also include rollover text, by including it in double apostrophes (&quot; &quot;), which is a good way to include sourcing information. I usually include a rollover text to tell the user where the &lt;em&gt;link&lt;/em&gt; will take them to, &lt;em&gt;if there is one attached&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I was editing the question, I would change the above image link to give the following result:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Every banner in Terraria][1]][1]&#xA;&#xA;    [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Z2Gi.png &quot;Banners @ terraria.wikia.com&quot;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Z2Gi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Banners @ terraria.wikia.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Z2Gi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Every banner in Terraria&quot; title=&quot;Banners @ terraria.wikia.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Final Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is worth addressing the fact that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be trying to improve &lt;em&gt;the entire&lt;/em&gt; question. If you make the edit to improve the image, but refrain from reviewing the rest of the question, this &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be considered bad form. You should always give the question a browse, and make any other improvements, if applicable. Does the user use correct spelling, punctuation and grammar? Does the title make sense? Are there any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; edits you could make to improve the question? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It is not as black and white as &quot;you post it, we own it&quot;, but there are some fair cases where it is.

This might come down to obvious falts in the original answers, providing you with feedback to create a better answer.

It's hard to search here for a lot of the topics that come up in game development, which makes finding duplicates tricky sometimes.

Statements and questions are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; acceptable titles, but they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work, together. I interpret this as a &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; language discrepancy, as I see this &quot;statement-question&quot; format used, a lot. Regardless, in &lt;em&gt;English grammar&lt;/em&gt;, it does not work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I felt, at this point, adding that the user &lt;em&gt;wanted to the object to stay at the position after movement completed&lt;/em&gt; was a bit obvious. Look at it this way, if your not moving anymore, you must therefore be &quot;still&quot;. This might seem like a minor caveat, but I'm a firm believer in ensuring the question title sounds inviting and non-awkward. To me, the inclusion of the obvious sounds awkward.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of &quot;then having it &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; at that point.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Much like in the title, I felt this added awkward redundancy to the question. When you stop moving, &lt;em&gt;you are still&lt;/em&gt;, you should not need to clarify so for us. Regardless, I included a smaller addition of &quot;and stay&quot;, which I feel confirms this requirement in a shorter way.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of tags &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%23&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c#&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c#&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/direction&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;direction&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;direction&lt;/a&gt; and the removal of the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vector&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;vector&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A non-event for the purpose of this discussion; I initially thought the tag change unnecessary, but I was wrong. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/direction&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;direction&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;direction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem more relevant to the question than &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vector&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;vector&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt;, which in retrospect, appears to fit in best as a &lt;em&gt;meta&lt;/em&gt; tag. Ultimately, we don't use tags if they only serve a &lt;em&gt;meta&lt;/em&gt; purpose, they should &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; categorise the question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restructure of the user's comment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, I did not find the change to offer &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; improvement to readability, past grammar and punctuation. I believe we should &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to use grammar and punctuation in comments, but in context, it is unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the asker intends to use pseudo-english in their comments, let them. Comments should not be important to the question, regardless.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Name change: &lt;code&gt;wak&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;target_position&lt;/code&gt;.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In singular context, an appropriate name change, but explaining that the user wants to move to the position &lt;code&gt;wak&lt;/code&gt; serves &lt;em&gt;the same purpose&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assumes that, in context of that specific asker's script, &lt;code&gt;wak&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; primarily the target destination. This may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be an accurate assumption; while the value may &lt;em&gt;provide&lt;/em&gt; the target destination, it is entirely likely that it could be primarily used for some &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In conclusion, the name change makes it easier to read &lt;em&gt;for everyone else&lt;/em&gt;. The simple explanation makes it easier to read for everyone else, &lt;em&gt;but retains its readability&lt;/em&gt; in direct context of the asker.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the edit was compared with the edit that was made, prior. I felt that I was able to best retain author intent, while make the question more readable, going off the previous edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question now makes complete sense. You might say that it made sense &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; my edit, but it did not necessarily make &lt;em&gt;grammatical&lt;/em&gt; sense. I take grammar into account, when I cast my votes, or rather I improve on any issues &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of down voting. In this case, I was &lt;em&gt;removing&lt;/em&gt; my down vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand the some users may confuse correct grammar, coming from a non-English background. I know other users may simply be &lt;em&gt;game developing geniuses&lt;/em&gt; with a less-ideal understanding of English, regardless of native language. This is all &lt;em&gt;completely fine&lt;/em&gt;, in my book, because we have users that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; knowledgeable enough to perform the cleanup, and despite the rare complaint regarding required effort, it does not require much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63208" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.667" LastActivityDate="2017-01-05T04:09:10.693" CommentCount="5" />

Just follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Just Google, for the point of example.&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for the download page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems as if it would be rather difficult to post a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; answer, &lt;em&gt;with out&lt;/em&gt; providing the link. This creates a Catch-22; it &lt;em&gt;can not&lt;/em&gt; be considered a good answer if it does not hold &lt;em&gt;with out&lt;/em&gt; the link. We have a very strict policy with this, to prevent good answers becoming bad answers due to link rot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;To a minor extent, the user is asking for &lt;em&gt;recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We consider &lt;em&gt;software and technology recommendation&lt;/em&gt; questions off-topic. I would only &lt;em&gt;loosely&lt;/em&gt; group these questions in with &quot;where can I download X?&quot;, but ultimately, the user is asking us to recommend a specific website to provide the appropriate technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One might argue that different answers may also lead to different 'preferred versions'.

I actually found the answers, in this case, &lt;em&gt;very helpful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Is X available to the public?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; lack of being able to find reference to a download, I see no reason why the user can not ask if there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a download.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might highlight the actual problem, as there was with the example question. A good answer would &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; provide links to the download, if valid, while still directly answering the question in &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; format.

I flagged it twice&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The first time, the flag &quot;aged away&quot;, but the second time, the flag was outright declined. This leads me to believe I have a misunderstanding of our general scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question asks how to use the Kinect as a microphone in Linux. The user does not state any form of relation to game development; they just want to use the microphone from their Linux computer. Here is the direct transcript of the original question, as it is quite minimal in content:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Originally I intend to use kinect camera as the device for voice communication. But at least now I want to use it as the input device for recording a voice and play that voice in the same pc. How can I do so? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and the kinect camera is of type Microsoft_Xbox_NUI_Sensor_043367545147-02-Sensor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A comment suggests that &quot;the Kinect is used in games, so it makes sense to ask it here&quot; - but that does not make sense to me, at all. We use a lot of hardware, in games. I would not expect a question asking how to set my Xbox up to be considered on topic, nor a question asking why my PlayStation errors when I try to connect it to the internet. For these questions, I would head to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gaming.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;the Arqade&lt;/a&gt;, where they specifically take video-game related questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I accept that the original user may have &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to state explicit use for game development, but without any mention of game development, that is just pure speculation. Without any mention of actual game development, interpreting the question in such a way also means we have to make a &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; on what they are actually using to develop their game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In what context do we allow &quot;how do I get this hardware to work&quot; questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I originally interpreted the ability to raise the second flag as confirmation that I had not raised the first flag.

Asset export / import scale.&lt;/strong&gt; A number of bugs can arise from exporting a mesh from a 3D modelling tool with one set of units and importing it into a game pipeline that expects different units:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Models showing up too big or too small.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Skeletons interpreted at a different scale than the vertex data, leading to the mesh vacuum-forming or ballooning out from its bones.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Animation data interpreted at a different scale than the mesh, leading to wacky exaggerated movement on translations like the start of a jump.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool game development related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;scripts packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;project or blogs from notable or just community devs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

We are currently &lt;em&gt;instructing&lt;/em&gt; users to do so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/tags/c%2B%2B11/info&quot;&gt;via the c++11 tag usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions may not simply be about &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; features; they may be about &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; features. For example, 'how do I do this, when I only have access to C++11, which predates the functions I would normally use?'&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am generally under the opinion that if you &lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em&gt; a question as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b11&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c++11&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c++11&lt;/a&gt;, you do not need to &lt;em&gt;mention&lt;/em&gt; that you are using C++11 in your question. Many other users follow this opinion, or at least, standard. I see this &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; when I answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unity&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;unity&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;unity&lt;/a&gt; questions. Many users omit the programming language &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt;, in the actual body of their question. This is never an issue, because they have used the &lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em&gt; to specify language. Likewise, the tag should tell other user's that 'this user is looking for an answer specific to C++11'.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The fact that there is no &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b14&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c++14&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c++14&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%233&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c#3&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c#3&lt;/a&gt; tag does not tell me that such tags are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; useful, they just tell me that they do not &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be useful, &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. It does not set precedent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the &lt;em&gt;tag excerpt&lt;/em&gt; could do with a slight improvement. As it stands, the usage excerpt states that 'c++11 replaced c++03'. I think it should &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; say that 'c++11 was replaced by c++14', as users may not be aware that there is a newer version, and thus &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; that their using c++11. It certainly would not hurt to specifically note that users should only use the tag if they are asking &lt;em&gt;specific c++11 questions&lt;/em&gt;, or otherwise looking for &lt;em&gt;an answer that is c++11 compatible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63208" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:18:53.667" LastActivityDate="2017-02-09T00:07:58.300" CommentCount="2" />

However, we should amend the usage guidelines. The guideline should address the fact that entity systems are not always component based, and suggest &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/component-based&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;component-based&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;component-based&lt;/a&gt; tag, if the user is specifically asking in context of a component based entity system.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity-component-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity-component-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity-component-system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;: I do not think we should implement this tag. Between &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity-system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/component-based&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;component-based&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;component-based&lt;/a&gt;, we have this covered. Furthermore, the two are not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; linked, so the single tag would not actually &lt;em&gt;replace&lt;/em&gt; the two separate tags.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity-component&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity-component&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity-component&lt;/a&gt;: I see this going one of two ways, but ultimately, I do not think we need this tag for the same reason we do not need the &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity-component-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity-component-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity-component-system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; tag. Given that the &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; appears to be specific to component-based entity systems, the questions using this tag should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity-system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/component-based&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;component-based&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;component-based&lt;/a&gt; tags. I think it might be &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; to simply merge the tag into &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity-system&lt;/a&gt; (specifically because it has more relevance to an entity system than a component-based system), but we should consider any potential to confuse users who note that we have the two as synonyms, and thus assume that they are synonyms &lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;by definition of how people are using the tags, themselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2327/63208&quot;&gt;As per &lt;em&gt;Alexandre Vaillancourt's&lt;/em&gt; answer&lt;/a&gt;, we should assess each question. Some questions appear more relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gameobject&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;gameobject&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;gameobject&lt;/a&gt;, in which case, they should be &lt;em&gt;re-tagged&lt;/em&gt;. Ultimately, I feel this tag should be made a synonym of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/entity-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;entity-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;entity-system&lt;/a&gt;, once the prior cleanup is complete.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While we are on the subject&lt;/em&gt;; I can find a couple more tags that &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; fall into the context of this discussion. However, for the purpose of quality control, my stance is that we should clean up the tags &lt;em&gt;already discussed&lt;/em&gt; before involving others. That said, when this reaches a resolution I am happy with, I might bring the other tags to the attention of meta, to ensure we are directing users and questions in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63208" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:43:58.067" LastActivityDate="2017-02-09T03:31:57.113" CommentCount="0" />

As you've mentioned, it's a grey zone. It's to be judged on a case-by-case basis. And since where human (at least most of us, I guess), we'll have different opinions (and even the same human can have different opinions over the same topic over time) about whether a link fits in or not, or if a link constitutes spam or not (although there are obvious situations). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things worth noting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The flag description can be misleading; unfortunately, I can't remember where I've seen this, but the comma in this text should be interpreted as &quot;and/or&quot;. This means that it's not because that the author's affiliation is disclosed that the post is not spam. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The flag acts on whole posts, not on specific parts. So it should be used only when the whole post is spam and can't be salvaged by editing out the spammy part. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The context in which the link occurs can be relevant:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Self promoting links in questions about a service are rarely something other than spam, or disguised spam.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Self promoting links in answers often end up being 'link only answers'. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Self promoting links in comments are in a grey zone.

Users should be encouraged to include the essential parts of the solution in the answer's body. Note that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/255554&quot;&gt;only if the answer is fully worthless without the link, it actually is a link-only answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answers that fail to address the question:&lt;/strong&gt; If the answer is not answering the question, it clutters the answer list and add noise to the site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/180029/303557&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Comments flags&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;no longer needed&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This comment is obsolete, chatty, or otherwise unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; pages, some questions or answers need clarification or improvements, and this can be is done via comments. When a user post an comment, and the post is updated accordingly, the comment is no longer needed. Flagging a comment with this reason is a way to tell a moderator that the comment should be removed because no longer needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comments are not for extended discussion. If the comments turn into a chat between a couple of users, without the aim to improve the question or answer, this is another valid reason to flag these comments. A moderator will likely move the comments to the chat and delete them from the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What flags are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; for&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Telling the user that their post sucks. &lt;em&gt;Use the downvote button instead.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Telling the user that their answer is wrong. &lt;em&gt;Leave a comment and use the downvote button instead.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Downvoting without losing rep. &lt;em&gt;Use your own rep instead, -1 rep will not kill you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Telling the user that their English is bad. &lt;em&gt;Suggest an edit instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Telling the user that they suck. Although you might feel annoyed that a certain user always asks very newb question, the flags and the downvotes are to qualify the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;not the user&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Either help the user by answering or commenting, or ignore the user and move on.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Did you notice?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These flags are there to ask moderators to &lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt; the post and possibly &lt;strong&gt;punish the author&lt;/strong&gt; (aside from &lt;em&gt;should be closed...&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a duplicate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in need of moderator intervention&lt;/em&gt; flags). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a very drastic measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, before flagging, please make sure that the issue with the post can't be fixed first by editing the post, then make sure flagging is really appropriate. If it's not, consider using the site's feature to notify the user that the content is not very good: use the downvote button. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And use the upvote button more often :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happy non-flagging!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40264" LastEditorUserId="40264" LastEditDate="2017-12-27T20:10:51.600" LastActivityDate="2017-12-27T20:10:51.600" Title="Please flag responsibly" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;flagging&gt;&lt;policy&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="4" FavoriteCount="1" />

In case you're not aware, you can get a summary of your flagging history from your profile. In the &quot;Activity&quot; tab, under the &quot;Impact&quot; section on the right, there's some text about &quot;X help flags cast.&quot; This text is a link to a summary page with some statistics about your flag casting and a list of every flag you've raised, including a blurb that explains why it may have been declined, if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the point of a flag is to bring attention to a post, either the attention of higher-reputation users (in the case of &quot;this should be closed&quot; flags available to those who cannot yet cast direct close votes) or the attention of the moderators (in the case of inappropriate behavior, abuse, and so on). If you are in doubt about which flag to cast, but &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that a post needs attention that you can't provide, flagging it in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; way is generally better than ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the most part nobody is going to get on your case about flagging incorrectly, so don't worry so much if flagging guidelines seem overly complex. Unless and until there's a trend of incorrectly-raised flags, it's not going to be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, please don't consider that a license to avoid even &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to interpret the post and find the correct flag. Almost every flag you raise causes human intervention, so you want to be respectful of your fellow members' time and energy when doing so.

As for the long answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off, I don't see a historical trend towards frequent migration to any of those sites. We don't migrate much of anything. Occasionally we send a question to Arqade, and prior to our tentative relaxation on the rules around general programming questions we'd send stuff to StackOverflow. But since that relaxation that's mostly dried up. &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/gamedev/query/552122/migration-rate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Our migration rate is 0.46%&lt;/a&gt; as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if I agreed that we should have the migration paths you are proposing (and I don't), there doesn't seem to be sufficient evidence to convince StackExchange of that. They tend only to enable direct migration paths when the frequency of migration is creating a burden for the source site. That is not happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, migration is a disruption, so we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; only be doing it rarely. It's historically poorly understood, which is why migration paths are not available to all users by default. Generally we only migrate a question when it's well-formed but blatantly off-topic here, and also blatantly on-topic somewhere else. If it's a junk question it gets closed, if it's on-topic here, it doesn't matter if it's on-topic somewhere else too. It stays here (especially if it's been answered).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastActivityDate="2017-03-22T14:17:24.870" CommentCount="2" />

For example, &quot;does this technology support efficient workflow&quot; would not allow for an absolute answer, as it comes down to each individuals interpretation of efficiency, and comparison to other systems. &quot;Does this system allow for 3D graphics&quot; &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; allow absolute answers; it either does, or it doesn't.

It's directly asking if there is anybody out there who ported Quake 3's physics to Unreal.

That's effectively a list-generation question, which we consider off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implication in the question is that you want to do this yourself. The implied follow-up is about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you could port the physics. That is a massively broad question, as there are several possible approaches to revamping a large engine's core physics simulation. All of them require a significant investment in knowledge of both the source and target engines, and conveying that knowledge in an answer on StackExchange would be almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, I closed the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to your complaints of abuse and unwarranted down-votes, well...

Such questions would be too broad for our scope, or be better posed on Stack Overflow; the user is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; going to have a specific language (or set of languages) relative to the system they are using, whether that be a pre-built game engine such as Unity or CryEngine, or a custom engine they have previously built in a specific language.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions that ask about general programming in relation to an engine &lt;em&gt;they have not built, yet&lt;/em&gt;. As brought up in previous meta, these questions are also generally too broad; for this reason, we are in the process of blacklisting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/engine&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;engine&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt; tag, given that it has no other practical use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As such, my vote is to blacklist this tag.

That's frequently useful to do when showing how to implement something natively in code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes however it's not the most effective means of communicating mathematics, and reading the post it looks like pseudocode has largely been used just because it's the only real option available. Things like saying &lt;code&gt;cross(vector1, vector2)&lt;/code&gt; can be simply expressed in &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; MathJax or pseudocode, and sometimes it's simpler and cleaner as MathJax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes pseudocode is expressing how to implement a very complex formula in code form, which is also extremely useful! This stuff should remain as-is. However, often it's difficult to understand what basic mathematical formula is actually happening, when it could be something as simply annotatable as a matrix-on-vector transformation. These pseudocode blocks would greatly benefit from being accompanied by a MathJax representation of what they're implementing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't read into all the cases where an author might've been happier writing out their pseudocode as MathJax, but I'm making an educated guess as to scenarios that would've been better that way, or where it would at least be excellent to &lt;em&gt;have a choice&lt;/em&gt; to use MathJax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;List of posts that would improve with MathJax&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pseudocode that is preferable being left as-is and is entirely adequate without a corresponding MathJax formula has not been counted for the purposes of this list.

It actually took a re-read to realise that the original post does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; contain any actual mention of game development. However, if you look at the language, it very much sounds like the user is asking in context of game development. In fact, they go as far as to confirm this in the comments. At best, the game development context should be strengthened through an edit to the post; this is an example of where we can &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; a question, rather than &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; it&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;There may be the opinion that the question is too broad, but we can fix that.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this applys to any opinion that the question is too broad. The user is asking for a &quot;best practice&quot;; perhaps there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an absolute best practice. If not, the key is to determine the askers &lt;em&gt;requirements&lt;/em&gt; for the &quot;best practice&quot;. In such cases, if you feel the question is too broad, ask some probing questions. Work out more specific requirements for what the user is asking. With more specific requirements, it is often very plausible to provide an absolute quality answer to these sort of questions; which generally negates the principle of a question being &quot;too broad&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I use the logic of your original comment, as I find it applies to 3D a lot more than &quot;programming&quot; does.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; You may find a few downvotes for lack of research, but we do not close them, other than as duplicates.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The fact that I initially interpret the question to apply to game development leads me to the conclusion that such an edit is, in fact, unnecessary; however, if others disagree, I would not argue against the resulting edit.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63208" LastActivityDate="2017-06-06T12:12:23.013" CommentCount="0" />

The first is to use object instances as nodes for trees, graphs, and other linked structures. This won't work though as game maker's idea of pointer doesn't work. The things they point two randomly shuffle. The documentation describes it &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamemaker.info/en/manual/403_05_instances&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Note that the assignment of the instances to the instance id's changes every step so you cannot use values from previous steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly the built in data structures will be deleted from memory when one uses the default mechanism for saving and loading (there is no alternative short of writing your own save mechanism).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only known workaround that isn't buggy is to write a C-style allocator from scratch and work from the bottom up.

XD&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the term &quot;game design&quot; gets applied very loosely among gamers, developers, educators, and game media alike, serving as a catch-all for &quot;doing stuff that contributes to a game&quot; rather than clearly identifying its own specialized discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best definition I know is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lizengland.com/blog/2014/04/the-door-problem/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Liz England's The Door Problem&lt;/a&gt;, with its extensive array of examples of design problem solving, though that's hard to boil down to an effective tag summary. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think Pikalek is on the right track in focusing on &lt;strong&gt;decisions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rules&lt;/strong&gt;.

This is explicitly considered off-topic here. The title of the question is asking for a list of resources (engines), which is also explicitly off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The task you appear to be trying to accomplish is extremely broad, and fundamentally &lt;em&gt;not any different&lt;/em&gt; than downloading any other kind of asset from the internet and doing something with it. There's lots of tutorials available for, for example, connecting to some CDN or web server endpoint via HTTP and bringing down a file.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other part of your task, loading that level you've downloaded, is also very basic and thus, as specified, very broad. How do you load any of the current levels you have, for example? It should be fundamentally no different provided you've done the first part (downloading the file to the correct location) correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the best way to improve your question and make it on-topic is for you to rewrite it to point out that what you're trying to do is implement this feature, and then describe what you have tried already and where you are stuck. Include things like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;where you are hosting the levels to be downloaded (some CDN like CloudFront? your own FTP server?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how do you want to download the levels (HTTP, perhaps)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how do you currently load levels from the disk in your game?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;what language and engine are you using?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1430" LastActivityDate="2017-07-24T02:18:09.407" CommentCount="0" />

This most often means formatting the text or fixing orthographic &amp;amp; grammatical mistakes. Thus generally okay and desirable from the point of views of the site and the author are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fixing the wrong spelling of words&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;replacing complex words with simpler words (to some extent)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;structuring a block of text into paragraphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;indenting code so it is displayed with the code formatting&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;indenting quotes so they are displayed as such&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fixing links to other sites (and optionally quoting their contents if necessary for the question)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;correctly linking images or even uploading them to imgur and linking to the original source&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above things strive to improve readability of the question. They also aim to improve consistency between questions on the stack and making sure that questions are still viable even if e.g. a link goes down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The edits that seem to have triggered your &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt; at first appear to be about improving the wording in the question, yet looking closer at them they also remove whole parts of sentences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this might be helping the question you now also start changing it - no matter if intently or inadvertently. At this point the OP steps in and tells you that your changes do modify the question into something they did not originally ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you start to insist on your changes making the question better and clearer. The OP insists on them making it worse. Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/posts/134838/revisions&quot;&gt;the revision history&lt;/a&gt;, this has continued for 6 revisions of back and forth.

The rolling back and forth of edits is indirect, there is no proper channel for any of you both to communicate your intents - thus it is happening in the first place&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Now you can either &lt;em&gt;continue your quest to improve the question&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;accept it and move on&lt;/em&gt;.

While SO gets the most focus due to its higher volume, we can see the same sentiments in our own users here on GDSE. Over the weekend, a user commented &quot;You know what. Stack exchange sucks. No one here is willing to help.

A lot of questions can reworded to fit with the theme of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, a lot of questions are off-topic and there's no reason to encourage users to ask similar ones. We still have problems (although rarely) with people referencing older (now off-topic) questions as a reason to why theirs shouldn't be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Aren't you afraid that you will burn out solving mundane issues that you could ignore before?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not afraid, the reason this election is happening is to make the life of the moderators a bit easier. I'm okay with doing a bit more work if one of the other moderators has to take a break, and I'm sure they'd so the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site helped me a lot in the last few years and I really enjoy hanging out in the chat room. I know this is cliché, but I want to return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Some community members have felt a change in the chat culture on the site. What are your thoughts on the current state of the site's chat room?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a frequent visitor of the chat room, I had the chance to experience the change. It was especially prominent during the summer (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/40506496#40506496&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for instance). It seems to get better right now though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Moderators have a rare ability to make unilateral changes to the site, bypassing checks that often require larger community consensus. What do you feel is the area most &lt;em&gt;in need&lt;/em&gt; of that kind of unilateral intervention today, and how would you address it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The area that needs the most focus in my opinion is the law side of the site. Most questions in this topic have a very low quality. What I'd do against this problem is to select or create some quality questions and use those to close the newer questions in this topic as duplicates (if one of the quality questions answers the new question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A huge percentage of questions get closed (roughly every 8th or 5000 out of the current 40,000 questions not counting the deleted ones), a big chunk of these ask for software, book or technology recommendations. What would you do to solve this issue?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason behind this is the fact, that new users don't read the help center. Instead of giving them a link to it, I'd suggest putting the main rules next to the textarea you use to write your question (ask question -&gt; yellow area). The content of this is borderline useless at this point of time. It is customizable, some other sites (most notably programming puzzles and code golf, which needs this because it isn't a Q&amp;amp;A site) have different rules there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What professional or hobby experience do you have that you think you'll be bringing to the role of moderating this community? This might include soft skills dealing with people, or professional experience having developed games (and if you have the latter, what games have you worked on, if you are willing/able to disclose?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm a hobby game developer, but I was hired to code chunks of medium budget games and plugins for server software multiple times before (excuse me for not saying the name of the games I've worked on, but I'm not a lawyer and I don't want to break an NDA accidentally).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I lead small and medium sized groups before and the feedback was usually good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;With great powers come great responsibilities and influence. As a newly elected moderator, what behaviour(s) that you had as a non-moderator will you change, if any, whether it is about voting, interactions with other users, interventions on meta, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't change much in my personality or behaviours. I'm always polite and respectful when I'm speaking to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something I'd change in how I operate on the site would be to visit the review queue once in a while. I tend to forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's always important to speak to the user in question first. Maybe he didn't even notice his own bad behavour because of cultural differences. If they don't change the way they communicate with others, then suspending the user is the way to go. If they continue with the bad behaviour even after the suspension, then banning the user is the only solution. I think it's more important to have a good atmosphere than to have good answers, because new users will come after the ban, but the user in question probably won't stay on the site forever, even if we don't ban them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I stated in the answer to the 10th question, discussing our own arguments first is important. I know the current moderators well enough, so that I know they won't just close something without having a reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="67769" LastEditorUserId="67769" LastEditDate="2017-10-24T15:58:53.117" LastActivityDate="2017-10-24T15:58:53.117" CommentCount="0" />

What (if anything) do you feel you should or could do to change this, as a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer to common, &lt;em&gt;broad&lt;/em&gt; game design questions is generally: prototype it and test it out. Actions speak louder than words, so code it, make it happen, and test. Everyone has ideas, but coding and testing holds the answers. Asking people for opinions before you've created a prototype isn't very constructive; questions like this should be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, however, the question poses a particular &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; design aspect that could be explored by analyzing how other games have implemented a similar design before, letting the question stay open would attract answers to gain knowledge and insight for all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allowing moderators (or as an option for user flags?) to mark such a question as, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;This is a Game Design question. When answering, please cite how existing games have implemented such a design&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, would let concrete answers to be posted, thus avoiding a collection of open-ended opinions. This way, users can share proven methods for how other games have implemented such a design. It's no longer an opinion piece, but stating facts instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, such a question would not have any true &quot;correct&quot; answer, and would probably need to be closed automatically after a week or so, or turned into a Community post. Still, I think there is merit in allowing the community to give concrete design examples to an open-ended question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;There's a perception among developers that StackExchange is elitist / unwelcoming, or that established/high-rep users are on a &quot;power trip&quot; and out to bully new users: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-decline-of-stack-overflow-7cb69faa575d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/741.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borngeek.com/2012/01/04/stack-overflow-hates-new-users/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fo/kTKqG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.

However, not everyone reads everything, and if you break a rule, the rule must get enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps allowing certain questions to stay open for a short time (24 or 48 hours?) would feel less harsh than closing immediately (even if the question still gets pruned later on). This way, the user gets some sort of answer (rather than reading through the comments), while also learning that they should ask a better-suited question next time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest offering moderators (or even changing the automatic flag/close system) with a close option, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;This question is too broad and will be closed in 48 hours&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Aren't you afraid that you will burn out solving mundane issues that you could ignore before?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can burn out on anything in life. Too many games to play, too many lines of code to write, too many moderation issues to resolve. But since moderation is a community-driven effort, knowing that the onus doesn't fall onto to just one person should help alleviate that burnout when it comes. Sometimes people need to take a break, and that's okay. So no, I am not afraid; I expect it to happen at some point. But burnout doesn't mean you leave it forever, you take a break and come back once refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to become a moderator because this sounds like a great opportunity to be more active with the site and community, and to help things foster and grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Some community members have felt a change in the chat culture on the site. What are your thoughts on the current state of the site's chat room?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personal attacks are never welcome. And when it comes to crude humour and swearing, different people have different lines. As soon as someone stops being polite, the ice can potentially become thin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've had a lot of laughs in the chat GDSE chat room over the years, but I've also seen a lot of drama. I've also seen some non-GDSE mods come in out of the blue and be less than friendly on the odd occasion, so if I were to become a mod, I would like to think I could remain calm, patient, and polite, to try and set a good example while figuring out how best to handle each situation as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the whole, the GDSE chat room is still a nice place to discuss game development, but I would say the crude humour has taken a back seat this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Moderators have a rare ability to make unilateral changes to the site, bypassing checks that often require larger community consensus. What do you feel is the area most &lt;em&gt;in need&lt;/em&gt; of that kind of unilateral intervention today, and how would you address it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel the UI suggestions posted on GDSE Meta sit for too long going without acknowledgement or progress. It took about three years for &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1624/can-we-get-a-hyperlink-style-for-chat-that-is-less-subtle&quot;&gt;GDSE's chat room link colour&lt;/a&gt; to get changed, yeah? If anything, if mods had the power to edit CSS styles to act on suggestions promptly, I believe it would be well-received.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A huge percentage of questions get closed (roughly every 8th or 5000 out of the current 40,000 questions not counting the deleted ones), a big chunk of these ask for software, book or technology recommendations.

As a newly elected moderator, what behaviour(s) that you had as a non-moderator will you change, if any, whether it is about voting, interactions with other users, interventions on meta, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If elected moderator, I imagine I will:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;aim to be even more polite in the chat room,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;work through the review queue more often,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;be more active on meta, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;retain the same voting habits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would likely warn the user of the repeated unwanted behaviour (citing the amount of flags against them), with suggestions on how to improve. If the negative comments continued (and if the mod tools allow it), I would prevent the user from posting comments for a time. After the time lapsed and the user could comment again but kept repeating their negative behaviour, a longer ban from commenting would be needed, and perhaps a permanent comment ban if their behaviour did not stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is an internal mod discussion system, I would raise the issue there. If not, then posting on Meta would likely be the next step.

I'd like to lead by example in applying this model (or future community improvements on it) until constructive guidance for design questions is as much a part of our shared lexicon as &quot;comments are not for extended discussion&quot; ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;There's a perception among developers that StackExchange is elitist / unwelcoming, or that established/high-rep users are on a &quot;power trip&quot; and out to bully new users...As a mod, how would you guide the community to provide a more welcoming first impression or onboarding experience for new users?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think a big part of this has to do with questions 1 &amp;amp; 7. For many users, their first experience with the site is having their earnest, vital question shut down before anyone could answer it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think the community is wrong to do this - we get a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of low-quality questions, and lowering our standards or opening the flood gates isn't a solution either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in the same vein as above, I think many of these questions can be rehabilitated with a modest investment on our parts. Especially if, through leading by example, we build a cultural norm around first attempting to improve questions before closing/downvoting, sharing the workload across the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, I think tone is a huge part of the equation - especially on the Internet where it's easy to read malice or aggression into innocent text. We've all been doing this long enough that the usual phrases like &quot;Asking for technology recommendations is not on-topic for this site&quot; just roll off the keyboard, but to a new user this can look like a very curt and gate-keeperly dismissal. Including in our routine a bit more explanation of why, or guidance to help the user to their next step, can radically change the emotional vibe of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even the automatic &quot;Possible duplicate of...&quot; comment can be edited if we catch it fast enough, and expanded to frame it as guiding the user toward immediate/already-vetted help for their problem - so that it doesn't read solely as chiding them for not searching first. I've been trying to do this recently and it's often better received than a bare duplicate flag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Aren't you afraid that you will burn out solving mundane issues that you could ignore before?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, definitely! But I think by adding more moderators through this election, we'll be able to share the growing load of the site more evenly, and there will be more flexibility for the team to adapt as individual mods' availability and focus naturally vary over time. We're all here for each other so no one person needs to push beyond what they can sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've learned a ton from participating in this community, and I want to give back, to help it thrive and offer the kinds of learning opportunities to other game creators that I've been so luck to enjoy here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Some community members have felt a change in the chat culture on the site. What are your thoughts on the current state of the site's chat room?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll confess, I haven't been as active in chat here as I feel I should be as a potential mod, and so I'm making a point to visit and participate there more frequently. So far, I don't think I have enough experience to answer this question well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Moderators have a rare ability to make unilateral changes to the site, bypassing checks that often require larger community consensus. What do you feel is the area most in need of that kind of unilateral intervention today, and how would you address it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, things seem to hum along pretty decently for the most part, thanks to the dedicated efforts of our existing mods and community members. I can't think of a major glaring issue that demands unilateral action that isn't already being handled reasonably.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd just like to help spread the maintenance load - particularly with regard to moderating comments and pruning outdated / off-topic discussion, since the non-mod tools are somewhat more limited in maintaining quality in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might like to use those powers for a bit of tag cleanup too. Right now, although I have a lot of rep, it's clustered in a small fraction of our tags, so there are lots of topics where I currently can't even propose synonyms. Not a dire problem for the site, but something I think I could better help with as a mod, so I'm not stuck waiting for the right question to come along before I can make an obvious improvement. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A huge percentage of questions get closed (roughly every 8th or 5000 out of the current 40,000 questions not counting the deleted ones), a big chunk of these ask for software, book or technology recommendations. What would you do to solve this issue?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recapping the theme from questions 1 &amp;amp; 2, I think there's a lot of opportunity to proactively improve questions &amp;amp; find the on-topic nugget buried inside, and promote this as a community value we can all help realize, so fewer questions need to be closed in the first place, or are abandoned in that state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions which are fundamentally off-topic like technology/book recommendations are a different matter though. I think we exclude these for good reason - our site's format simply isn't the best way to handle this type of question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think Bálint's suggestion to improve the question guidance presented immediately beside the question authoring field is a vital step here, and I'd love to collaborate on proposed content. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there's a deeper issue though, that users tend to ask these broad/suggestion-polling questions when they're uncertain of themselves. Often it seems like they lack confidence in a topic to form their actual question, so they ask for &quot;general guides&quot; hoping what they need will turn up in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is another area where cultivating community norms around supporting new users as discussed in 2 could be beneficial. When a user expects to be welcomed and guided, it's easier for them to open up and describe what they're doing, with less apprehension that they'll be pounced on for going about it the &quot;wrong&quot; way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What professional or hobby experience do you have that you think you'll be bringing to the role of moderating this community? This might include soft skills dealing with people, or professional experience having developed games (and if you have the latter, what games have you worked on, if you are willing/able to disclose?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been designing games professionally for ten years, specializing in systems design, user interface, economy balancing, and design communication, in both indie and AAA contexts. Along the way I've gotten to explore a wide array of development problem spaces, including localization, motion controls, multi-touch/multi-user interfaces, custom controller hardware, working within existing &amp;amp; controlled brands, and developing/pitching original game IPs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also have teaching experience in game mechanics and balancing through Sheridan's bachelor of game design program, and algorithm design &amp;amp; analysis as a TA with Stanford online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue applying this background in communication and teaching to cultivating a productive learning environment for all our users here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My commercial game titles include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCCnSWftTFQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Flip's Twisted World&lt;/a&gt; (2010, Wii, indie, 3rd-person action-puzzler)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHr1RjvRkJs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Splinter Cell Blacklist&lt;/a&gt; (2013, Xbox 360, PS3, PC, Wii U, 3rd-person stealth-action)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpTlQG6c3lE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Starlink: Battle for Atlas&lt;/a&gt; (2018, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, toys-to-life 3rd-person open world spaceship-flying/building action-adventure)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My non-commercial titles include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installation games for Toronto's Nuit Blanche festival&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2I-ONO3OGs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Go Poser Go&lt;/a&gt; (2014 - play pictionary with your silhouette while the crowd guesses on their phones)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pic.pimg.tw/yangnew/1487414880-3663780864.jpg?v=1487414892&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pixelate&lt;/a&gt; (2015 - visitors get digitized into 4 eras of videogame history, from 8-bit platformer to modern day)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game jam creations (I'm an avid jammer!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn9JEMfEZg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Glimpse&lt;/a&gt; (2014 - exploratory puzzle game where the world can change when you blink)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/D_M_Gregory/status/716778145374978050&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Quarky&lt;/a&gt; (2016 - board game using red/blue eyeglasses and pieces, so two different boards exist in superposition)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_nVCkj-oGg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Last One Standing&lt;/a&gt; (2016 - 6-player free-for-all domino domination)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;With great powers come great responsibilities and influence. As a newly elected moderator, what behaviour(s) that you had as a non-moderator will you change, if any, whether it is about voting, interactions with other users, interventions on meta, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a habit of being stubborn, and arguing a point longer than I should, something I've already been working to curb. I'd need to be extra-vigilant, recognizing that each message I post reflects not only on myself as a user, but on the site and its moderation community. I'd also need to act with awareness that the power imbalance between a mod and a regular or new user colours how all my interactions are perceived, however well-meaning they may be. I'd need to practice restraint, recognizing that an (in my opinion) imperfect question/answer/comment is very often better than an alienated community member.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, as I understand it, a mod's close vote closes the question instantly. To date, I've been relatively loose with close votes in situations I saw as borderline but wasn't clear how to fix - on the logic that others have a chance to disagree or make changes without the closure taking effect. I'd need to be much more judicious with closing, and only close a question when I'm certain that it's off-topic or causing harm in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd want to discuss this with the user, in chat or a private channel if they'd prefer, to try to guide them to a more harmonious relationship with the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've had a number of these problems myself as I've been gradually learning more about the site, and I benefited greatly from mods and fellow users taking the time to explain why we do things a certain way on StackExchange, and showing examples of how to use the site more productively. I'd try to give this user those kinds of learning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the event of misunderstandings or differences of opinion about site conventions/norms &amp;amp; best practices, a meta thread explaining the concept can be effective for showcasing productive behaviours without calling anyone out explicitly, developing consensus as a check on my own bias, and also as a resource for all users' future reference. These threads by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2115/a-close-vote-is-not-a-super-downvote&quot;&gt;Josh Petrie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2079/39518&quot;&gt;MAnd&lt;/a&gt; for example helped clear up misconceptions I'd held.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If problems persist, I'd discuss with the other mods what types of measures are best to dissuade the user from antagonizing the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If absolutely necessary, I'd rather suspend or ban a productive but inflammatory community member, rather than have them continue to upset or alienate our community here. Good answers are comparatively easy to come by, but a friendly collaborative community takes years to cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm still pretty junior in my understanding of StackExchange conventions, so my first guess would be that there's something I don't know or have overlooked about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd try to reach out and discuss the issue with the other mod in another channel, like chat, or a private message if they prefer / if it pertains to sensitive information. I'd ask questions to understand the choice to close/delete, and if I still feel it should have been done differently, present my thoughts on why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we're ultimately unable to come to a consensus to reverse the decision, or the other mod is not available or interested in discussing it, I'd typically let the existing decision stand. It's easy to post a new question or answer, so no permanent damage is done even if I disagree with it. Escalating to the other mods, or causing a scene or edit/modding war would likely be more disruptive to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think further escalation to other mods would only be required if it became a persistent issue - like targeted blocking against a particular user / topic not in violation of the rules. For everyday differences of opinion, I think the site format gives us a lot of room to live and let live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="39518" LastActivityDate="2017-10-24T05:37:37.727" CommentCount="8" />

What (if anything) do you feel you should or could do to change this, as a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best thing to do is comment on new questions to help the authors narrow them to fit the Q&amp;amp;A format better. A game design question that focuses on a certain problem well enough can work. As a moderator, my comment will carry some extra weight in guiding the community toward what we think is acceptable with regard to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;There's a perception among developers that StackExchange is elitist / unwelcoming, or that established/high-rep users are on a &quot;power trip&quot; and out to bully new users: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-decline-of-stack-overflow-7cb69faa575d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/741.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borngeek.com/2012/01/04/stack-overflow-hates-new-users/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fo/kTKqG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. While SO gets the most focus due to its higher volume, we can see the same sentiments in our own users here on GDSE. Over the weekend, a user commented &quot;You know what. Stack exchange sucks. No one here is willing to help. It’s always just: “no you can’t ask your question like that!” This is a question which can be answered with one answer...But then again no one’s here to actually help.&quot; As a mod, how would you guide the community to provide a more welcoming first impression or onboarding experience for new users?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a similar way to Question 1 above, I would be commenting on these questions in a way that guides the new user and displays proper attitude to existing users. It's true we can be unwelcoming; this is because of years of dealing with poorly-asked questions from new users. We have to remember that they don't know what we've been through. The trick is to remain welcoming while not compromising the goal of creating a database of Q&amp;amp;A that is helpful to future visitors, not just the askers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Aren't you afraid that you will burn out solving mundane issues that you could ignore before?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't worry me because I like helping make GDSE a better place, even if it is through performing mundane tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a game designer, I have a very strong interest in creating sets of rules and guidelines for governing interactions between people. It's the main function I performed while running my corporation and alliance in EVE-Online, which is still going after more than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Some community members have felt a change in the chat culture on the site. What are your thoughts on the current state of the site's chat room?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I regret the loss of some great contributors due to a recent tightening of the regulation of the chatroom. However, it is my opinion that we do need to keep it safe for work. I have that window open all day while I'm working, and it embarrasses me if coworkers see unpleasant stuff there. At the moment, it seems to be going smoothly, and I would work to keep the moderation there even-handed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Moderators have a rare ability to make unilateral changes to the site, bypassing checks that often require larger community consensus.

Many of these questions are asked by brand new accounts who have not read the Help Center.

I have worked on many games in the industry: My Word Coach DS, Splinter Cell PSP, Tiny Brains, Pro Feel Golf, Knightfall: Rivals, as well as around of 15 Shockwave and Javascript games in the early 2000s (to name a few... there are many more things I've worked on, some of which were never published). I have completed 3 boardgame designs, with one published; these are well-received by players of all kinds, and range from very complex to very simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;With great powers come great responsibilities and influence.

What (if anything) do you feel you should or could do to change this, as a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s a tricky one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there is some room for lowball, relatively generic questions about game design. After all, the site is about game development, so why ban them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main issue I see related to this type of question is threefold: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First: This type of question tend to hit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=hot&quot;&gt;Hot Network Questions&lt;/a&gt; list, and since they’re “easy to answer by anyone”, we get a load of users answering the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second: some users seem too happy to have finally found a question they can answer that they don’t take the time to read answers that have already been posted, answers which contain the exact same details that they’re about to write. We then end up having some good quality answers, and some answers that could be seen as repeated content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third: Rep is hard to get. Below a certain threshold, I think users feel they can’t downvote because it would cost them precious rep (that’s perfectly understandable, I’ve been there too). Thus users are shy and don’t downvote questions that should be downvoted for not being useful (that’s what the little down arrow says). Downvotes send a message to users, but it’s sometimes not that clear (Why is my answer not useful?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What could/should I do as a mod about this? Nothing drastic. The way I see the issue, I think a downvote, accompanied with a friendly message should help with this kind of situation. I see it a bit like leading by example: use the features of the site and encourage others to do it, and refine the message sent by the downvote by letting the user know why they received a downvote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the questions hitting the HNQ list make me sigh once in a while, I think having questions from GD.SE there is beneficial to the community as it gives us visibility. And I don’t think a mod has any right to delete answers only because the content has been covered by other answers. Downvotes are for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;There's a perception among developers that StackExchange is elitist / unwelcoming, or that established/high-rep users are on a &quot;power trip&quot; and out to bully new users: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-decline-of-stack-overflow-7cb69faa575d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/741.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borngeek.com/2012/01/04/stack-overflow-hates-new-users/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fo/kTKqG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. While SO gets the most focus due to its higher volume, we can see the same sentiments in our own users here on GDSE. Over the weekend, a user commented &quot;You know what. Stack exchange sucks. No one here is willing to help. It’s always just: “no you can’t ask your question like that!” This is a question which can be answered with one answer...But then again no one’s here to actually help.&quot; As a mod, how would you guide the community to provide a more welcoming first impression or onboarding experience for new users?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t witnessed a lot of the issues described above on GD.SE. But yes, it can be harsh for new users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below each question, there is an option to cast a close vote. With 5 votes, the question gets closed, and a message box is added below the question. This is standard. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the issue is that some users don’t read. They don’t read the message in the box, or they don’t read the help center. This is also standard, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The message boxes have been added so that the users voting to close the question don’t have to type the same thing every time they cast a vote, or close the question. This has unfortunately the side effect of cutting the “human”/”direct” relationship between the new user and the community members (or the mod) who closed the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That would be adding work for the community and the mods, but I think leaving a kind comment to the new user telling them why their question has been closed, suggesting alternatives and telling them a bit more why questions such as theirs don’t fit on the site can actually bring more light on how this site works. That would at least open the door to a dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have had many occurrences of users thanking me for having given them a pointer like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, we could post more Meta questions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1692/can-we-please-be-more-friendly-to-new-users&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2124/a-bit-of-kindness-vs-ripping-into-newbs-attempts-at-answers&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and feature them once in a while when there is nothing else important going on. I think this could help the community be more welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Aren't you afraid that you will burn out solving mundane issues that you could ignore before?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m in the top 1 of three review queues, and top 3 of the three others, and in the top 2 for edits (Josh is &lt;em&gt;far ahead&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so. I might end up spending more time solving mundane issues, and less time on the review queues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As described in my nomination text:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a mod, I'd like also to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;work &quot;in the shadows&quot; to help have a nice site for current users;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;help guide the community to offer an even more welcoming site for future users;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;close questions that should be closed earlier;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;handle spam and other flags faster (right now, I generate work for the mods; I could &lt;em&gt;handle&lt;/em&gt; flags instead of &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; some :P).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Some community members have felt a change in the chat culture on the site. What are your thoughts on the current state of the site's chat room?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the chat is much more quiet than it was before the culture change, I think the change was a good thing. It is now more in line with the rest of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also feel that we’re slowly re-building a momentum with new regulars. Some users there are really smart and knowledgeable and are very good at helping other users that have questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Moderators have a rare ability to make unilateral changes to the site, bypassing checks that often require larger community consensus. What do you feel is the area most &lt;em&gt;in need&lt;/em&gt; of that kind of unilateral intervention today, and how would you address it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I don’t see that kind of need. Maybe that’s just because I’m used to bring issues to Meta when I see something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know there are things that could be done to improve the site, but that would require the involvement of the community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, we could try to improve unclear questions by editing the question’s text with what has been discussed in the comments, and then delete the comments as they would add noise. Deleting comments can only be done by a mod. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could also try to encourage users to post answers as answers instead of doing so in the comments of the question. Like my previous suggestion, someone could write the answer then flag the comment for a mod to delete it. (A mod could do all of this alone, and end up accused of being on a power trip.:P) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without a momentum coming from at least an active part of the community, these changes of philosophy could be hard to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A huge percentage of questions get closed (roughly every 8th or 5000 out of the current 40,000 questions not counting the deleted ones), a big chunk of these ask for software, book or technology recommendations. What would you do to solve this issue?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure there is much to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some users don’t read the rules before posting, some read them but don’t understand them, some read them and don’t think they apply to them, some read them and forget them. That’s standard, and that does not happen only here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I understand of the way the site is engineered, allowing users to post off-topic/too broad questions is &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; a feature: remove the fences from the top of the cliff and allow the user to fall, i.e. allow users to post (they don’t even need an account!). If the post is not right (they have fallen off the cliff), there is going to be a safety net to catch them: the question is going to be fixed by the community (either edited to fit in, or simply closed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s one of the strengths of StackExchange sites in general. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What professional or hobby experience do you have that you think you'll be bringing to the role of moderating this community? This might include soft skills dealing with people, or professional experience having developed games (and if you have the latter, what games have you worked on, if you are willing/able to disclose?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experience that would help me be a good mod (mainly training my leadership and my patience):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have been a Boys-and-Girls-Scout Chief for 4 years. During that time, I’ve been leading a pack of young teenagers. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have a 1 year old baby. Doing things takes waayyy much longer than what they used to. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I’m occupying a leading role where I currently work; among other things, I’ve lead the team to better management practices and improved processes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the past, I had to work with hard-to-work-with colleagues. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experience related to software and games:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My day job is about programming 3d realtime simulations in c++, and everything related to that (architecture, optimization, etc). I admit that I still have &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to learn, but I would say that I know a lot too! (Fortunately, I love to learn and improve my skills.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been have been developing games for a couple of years in the past.&#xA;-- a couple of Flash games (platformers)&#xA;-- I’ve been the main/lead programmer on 2-3 Nintendo DS titles (targeted at little girls: Horses and Air Attendant themed games).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have a bachelor’s degree in game creation. (And a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science/Software engineering, and all the classes required for a Master’s degree in Computer Science.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;With great powers come great responsibilities and influence. As a newly elected moderator, what behaviour(s) that you had as a non-moderator will you change, if any, whether it is about voting, interactions with other users, interventions on meta, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the only thing that will change is the way I vote to close. Since moderator’s votes are binding, aside from the obvious questions that require to be closed, I’ll let the community use their privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep on trying to be kinder to users, and keep on being active on meta :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s because someone contributes well and a lot that it places them above the basic rules of the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After giving them a couple of warning shots, I think that the normal course of action would be to suspend them. This is unfortunate, but I don’t see why we’d make special exceptions to the rules for them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s sad to say, but that kind of user is “replaceable”. It can take time to happen, but users with great skills come by once in a while and give great contributions to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When guiding the community, the moderators team should be seen as such: a team. They should show unity to the community, at least when it is about the direction of the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is such a discrepancy between two or more moderators, they should talk together first and arrive to a consensus. If the consensus is that the question should be reopened, or undeleted, the mod who performed the first action on the question should be the one who re-opens it. Otherwise, I feel that this would be interpreted as everyone having their own agenda, and it’s generally not good when guiding a community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a team of six moderators, this kind of situation will happen more often than with only four. The consensus could still be that it should be closed, and that’s fine, as long as it does not create an internal war, in such case the community will suffer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40264" LastActivityDate="2017-10-25T22:47:33.307" CommentCount="2" />

The purpose of the SE network is to provide good answers to questions and to eliminate the need of searching through dozens of random forums to find what you're looking for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we have 50 different questions with the same &quot;Please identify this piece of software for me&quot; title and with a gif in the questions body, then there's no chance they are ever going to pop up in a Google search and they might as well get deleted if they only help for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great example to follow in my opinion is the movie SE. They have strict rules on identification requests. You need to give the question a descriptive title, you need to write a couple of lines of text in the question's body and you need to provide as much details about the movie, as you can (art style, the date you saw it/got released, etc.). If we do the same, then this feature has a good chance of becoming useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the problem of how you describe something, this is why, for instance, Anime SE banned id requests some time ago. Different opinions make it close to impossible to find questions about the software you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, there's the problem with customization. I've seen examples of IDEs getting customized to look like a different ones, because the programmer liked that style (I remember a conversation on r/programminghorror, that occupied 4 and a half screens, because someone asked the OP what IDE he used and no one could recognize it. It was sublime 3 modified to look like VS with IntelliJ-like recommendations)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="67769" LastEditorUserId="67769" LastEditDate="2017-11-15T15:11:02.407" LastActivityDate="2017-11-15T15:11:02.407" CommentCount="1" />

Letting users tag a question with &lt;code&gt;unity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unity-2017&lt;/code&gt; that is not specifically about the features that are exclusive to that version will end up polluting the new tag anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the feature you're mentioning seems to have been implemented in Unity 2017.2. To be perfectly consistent, we'd need a tag for each release of Unity in order to cover the new features. I don't think it's a good idea as we'll end up with a lot more of what I've described before. What if you need a feature from Unity 2017.2 and one from Unity 2018.1? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've also decided in the past to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2150/how-should-we-handle-the-inspector-tag-and-unity-tags&quot;&gt;convert unity-related tags&lt;/a&gt; to being synonym of &lt;code&gt;unity&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe the concept of tilemap in Unity 2017.2 is so different than what the basics of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tilemap&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;tilemap&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;tilemap&lt;/a&gt; are that we'd need a &lt;code&gt;unity-tilemap&lt;/code&gt; tag. But then again, we'd need a watchdog for that tag, able to distinguish if the question is about using the feature of the engine or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/search?q=[unity]+[tilemap]+2017.2&quot;&gt;use the search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40264" LastEditorUserId="40264" LastEditDate="2017-11-20T19:02:37.947" LastActivityDate="2017-11-20T19:02:37.947" CommentCount="8" />

People are still making games for downright ancient systems and tech.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've helped ship AAA games on forks of engines over a decade old (in the 2010s we could still find fossilized comments from the 90s). And I think we all have a chunk of our codebase somewhere that we now know is horribly outdated but just not bad enough to be critical to replace just yet. It happens. It might not be what we'd call &quot;best practice&quot; but if a thing works, it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I think the answer to all of these questions ends up being &quot;yes&quot; in the sense of &quot;nobody will stop you&quot; but also &quot;no&quot; in the sense of &quot;if you decided to ask, you probably already know there are 'better'/more popular options you should probably use today&quot; without a lot of conclusive evidence we can present either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Sure, Flash support is officially ending, but sufficiently-motivated players still dig out and maintain their original NES systems, so is a lack of support an absolute deal-breaker?

For example, whether OpenTK is still being actively developed or not is something that can be determined based on objective evidence: look at their repositories for any recent check-ins, and see how many. Look at their bug lists and see how frequently they close bugs. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Flash question in particular is interesting due to the fact that, not only is it being discontinued by its owner, it is such a pariah in the web world that there are &lt;em&gt;numerous&lt;/em&gt; browser extensions that exist for the sole purpose of killing it.

We should do some editing to convert those to use mathematical formulae.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please work on the ones you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; confidently work on as necessary. Once you've edited a post, delete it from this list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What do we change or &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;check;&lt;/strong&gt; If a post is displaying &lt;strong&gt;complex mathematical equations or notation&lt;/strong&gt; that would benefit from being laid out in MathJax instead, convert those equations to MathJax.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;cross;&lt;/strong&gt; If a post is displaying minimal simple math (e.g. &quot;a = 1 + 2&quot;) it's not really worth converting to MathJax.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;cross;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do not replace pseudocode with Mathjax.&lt;/strong&gt; Pseudocode is intended to be easily translated into actual computer code, sometimes even copy-pasted with minimal adjustments. Replacing it with MathJax would be a detriment to our site's utility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;check;&lt;/strong&gt; Do augment pseudocode with adjacent MathJax, when the mathematical notation would help people understand what's going on in the pseudocode. There are many equations that are simple to express as an equation, but complex and difficult to read when expressed as code. If it's not one of these cases (the mathematical equation is either more difficult to read than the code, or adds no net benefit in legibility) probably don't worry about this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the line between points 1 and 3 will be blurry.

For display-mode formulas (i.e. multiline, centered formulas which take up their own paragraph), use &lt;code&gt;$$ ... $$&lt;/code&gt;. Various symbols will be displaye differently in inline vs multiline mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, the equation &lt;code&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}&lt;/code&gt; renders in inline mode (&lt;code&gt;\$&lt;/code&gt;) as the following: \$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}\$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in display mode (&lt;code&gt;$$&lt;/code&gt;) it displays as: $$ \sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6} $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note the &lt;code&gt;$$&lt;/code&gt; also breaks it out into its own lines and centers it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Display formulas can have multiple lines. Insert a line break with &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Grouping&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MathJax operates on symbols or groups of symbols. Usually, a MathJax operator that's expecting to do something fancy with some symbols will grab just the very first symbol available and nothing more. For example, &lt;code&gt;a^bc&lt;/code&gt; will be displayed as \$a^bc\$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we want to represent that as \$a\$ to the power of \$bc\$ we instead need to &lt;strong&gt;group these symbols&lt;/strong&gt; using curly braces, i.e. &lt;code&gt;{ }&lt;/code&gt;. So we'd write &lt;code&gt;a^{bc}&lt;/code&gt; instead: \$a^{bc}\$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get literal curly braces by escaping them: &lt;code&gt;\{foo\}&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; \$ \{foo\} \$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Basic mathematical formatting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical operations.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (hyphen), &lt;code&gt;\times&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\div&lt;/code&gt;: \$1 + 2 - 3 \times 4 \div 5\$.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;alternately &lt;code&gt;\cdot&lt;/code&gt; for the multiplication dot, \$ x \cdot y \$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;\pm \mp&lt;/code&gt; for \$\pm \mp\$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;\gt&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\lt&lt;/code&gt; for \$\gt \lt\$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;\ge&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\geq&lt;/code&gt; for \$\ge\$, or &lt;code&gt;\geqslant&lt;/code&gt; for \$\geqslant\$. Similarly for less-than-or-equal: &lt;code&gt;\le&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\leq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\leqslant&lt;/code&gt;: \$\le \leqslant\$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Approximately equal: &lt;code&gt;\approx \sim \simeq&lt;/code&gt; give you \$\approx \sim \simeq\$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superscripts and subscripts.&lt;/strong&gt; use &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;. These can be combined. For example, &lt;code&gt;x_i^2&lt;/code&gt; renders as \$x_i^2\$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fractions.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two options:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;\frac a b&lt;/code&gt; grabs the next two groups: \$\frac{a+1}{b+1}\$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You may instead prefer to use &lt;code&gt;\over&lt;/code&gt; to write &lt;code&gt;{a+1 \over b+1}&lt;/code&gt;: \${a+1 \over b+1}\$ when the equations on either side are complex.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greek letters.&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;code&gt;\alpha&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\beta&lt;/code&gt;, …, &lt;code&gt;\omega&lt;/code&gt;: \$\alpha, \beta \ldots \omega\$. For uppercase, use &lt;code&gt;\Gamma&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\Delta&lt;/code&gt;, …, &lt;code&gt;\Omega&lt;/code&gt;: \$\Gamma, \Delta, \ldots \Omega\$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plain text in equations:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually all text is treated as symbols, so &lt;code&gt;these are some words&lt;/code&gt; gets rendered as \$these are some words\$ despite the spaces. To tell MathJax to treat it as just ordinary text, use &lt;code&gt;\text{stuff}&lt;/code&gt;: \$\text{these are some words}\$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floor and ceiling.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/code&gt; for \$\lfloor x \rfloor\$, &lt;code&gt;\lceil x \rceil&lt;/code&gt; for \$\lceil x \rceil\$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Equation alignment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;\begin{align} ... \end{align}&lt;/code&gt; environment to align equations over multiple lines. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; symbol is an alignment marker in this environment. Use &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt; to start new lines.

Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things.

It definitely won't help you later (after school, in later assignments, on tests, etc.) and it could be, at best, very embarrassing if you are asked to explain code you turned in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to answer and moderate homework questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to provide explanation that will lead the asker in the correct direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's usually better not to provide a complete code sample if you believe it would not help the student, using your best judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognize that homework is likely to include artificial constraints, and honor those constraints. Also be aware that these constraints may affect whether or not a question should be closed as a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't downvote others who answer homework questions in good faith, even if they break these guidelines (unless the answer would merit downvotes even if the question weren't homework related).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be respectful when guiding towards best practices &amp;amp; good habits, even if it's something that seems obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't downvote a homework question that follows the guidelines and was asked in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be polite when asking if a question is homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use your best judgment.

We're constrained to using what's publicly known. And your situation seemed odd, because it did not fit with what we know. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Digging around a bit more, and going back to the basics, reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/question-bans&quot;&gt;help center page on question bans&lt;/a&gt;, I found this little paragraph at the end of the page:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you're unable to improve your existing questions, you'll get the chance to ask a new one 6 months after your last question. &lt;strong&gt;If that question is positively received&lt;/strong&gt;, you may be able to continue asking questions; if not, then the ban will be reinstated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(The emphasis is mine.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I read it, it means that if that question-after-a-6-months-ban does not get upvoted, you'll be banned from asking questions again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems to fit your situation: your new question did not get upvoted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you revisit some of your old, deleted questions, improve them, bring them on topic, make them answerable and &quot;up-voteable&quot; and un-delete them. If there are questions in the comments, edit the question to address these, etc. This might help raise the question ban. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of your question about how to play a sound with OpenAL. You could try and add more details about your current implementation to narrow its scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also try to reword your question about the architectural patterns in a way that it presents a specific issue that you have with a pattern that you need to use in you specific application. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As stated on the help page I quoted above, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Stack Exchange cannot lift question bans by request.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, so I assume that the ball is in your court now. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40264" LastActivityDate="2018-05-28T15:08:25.597" CommentCount="3" />
