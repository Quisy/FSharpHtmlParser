This is going to be long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Identification questions are &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike, say, literary analysis, or questions about plot points in specific works of literature, identification questions are almost always inspired by &lt;strong&gt;an actual problem someone needs to solve&lt;/strong&gt;. In this sense, they fit the Stack Exchange model better than many other questions about literature are likely to! From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&quot;&gt;help centre&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ID questions fit all of this to a tee: people usually post them because they actually want to find a book they've read before, perhaps so that they can reread it. By solving these questions, we're helping people in a bigger way than just satisfying their idle curiosity. OK, we're never going to be like Stack Overflow or Maths SE where people's jobs might depend on getting answers to the questions they post there, but any amount of practical help is better than none, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plus, not only are they helpful to the OP, but believe it or not, &lt;strong&gt;they're helpful to &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt; too&lt;/strong&gt;. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/9758/31394&quot;&gt;gathered some statistics on this&lt;/a&gt; a while back from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scifi.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Science Fiction &amp;amp; Fantasy&lt;/a&gt; SE, which is probably the best existing analogue to Literature, being the only other SE site where questions about fictional books can be asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On SFF, two story ID questions are considered to be duplicates if and only if they have the same accepted answer, so we can get a good lower bound on the number of OPs helped by previous questions by searching for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/search?q=[story-identification]+is%3Aquestion+duplicate%3A1&quot;&gt;duplicate ID questions&lt;/a&gt;, of which there are currently &lt;strong&gt;657&lt;/strong&gt;, plus a further &lt;strong&gt;39&lt;/strong&gt; which have been deleted. That makes about 700 people who had their problem solved by existing ID questions on the site despite &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being the OP. (This is only a lower bound because we don't close as duplicate unless both answers are accepted, even if the two questions are obviously seeking the same story. The actual figure here could be in the thousands.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, we see a great many people posting answers along the lines of &quot;I was looking for the same story!&quot;, which rapidly get deleted or converted to comments. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bstory-identification%5D+is%3Aanswer+same+deleted%3A1&quot;&gt;ran a search&lt;/a&gt; (mod-only, sorry) which yielded &lt;strong&gt;190&lt;/strong&gt; such answers. There might be a few false positives here, but almost all of these results will be from someone who's not the OP but still found the question useful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this shows that a significant proportion of the 8500 ID questions on SFF are useful enough that people actually post duplicates or non-answers to them. Of course there must be many &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; ID questions which people simply read, think &quot;aha, that solved my problem&quot;, and don't post anything to that effect on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book&lt;/em&gt; ID questions tend to be higher quality.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me address head-on the complaint which many people from other SE sites are likely to have. On &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, most of the highly active users see ID questions as the bane of the site: that site gets multiple &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt; ones posted every day, with so little detail that they're often impossible to answer uniquely. I believe a few other sites have banned identification questions altogether. SFF is one of the few Stack Exchange sites which gets generally good quality ID questions and thrives on them as part of a healthy combination of topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this?&lt;/strong&gt; As a reasonably active user on both SFF and M&amp;amp;TV, I've often pondered this question, and I think the answer is more to do with medium than genre. When reading a book, you usually need to exercise your imagination more: you can't see what the characters look like, so you have to give them faces and voices inside your head, and that makes the details more likely to stick there. Plus a book tends to be more of a long-term commitment: you can be done with a film in a few hours, or even just glimpse parts of it in a shop or on a plane or on the TV while you're doing something else, but to read a book you need to sit down and give it your full attention for a longer period, which again makes it more likely to stick in your head better. I think that &lt;strong&gt;on average, people are more likely to retain the details of a book they've read than a film they've seen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I've also discovered on SFF that &lt;strong&gt;book ID questions tend to be higher quality than film ID questions&lt;/strong&gt;. This vague gut feeling is backed up by quantitative evidence. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/scifi/query/617249/average-question-score-of-tag-combinations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this Data.SE query&lt;/a&gt;, the average score of ID questions tagged with [movies] on SFF is 5.49 while the average score of those tagged with [short-stories] is 8.55. This isn't too great a statistic, since many story ID questions on SFF don't have any medium tag, but it's still quite a striking difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Let's give them a chance.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I think identification questions should be a very useful category for our site. Let's not ban them, at least not right away. &lt;strong&gt;Let's give it a couple of months and see what kind of questions we get.&lt;/strong&gt; If we discover after a while that the questions we're getting tend to be low-quality, we can decide to impose stricter regulations on them, or even ban them altogether. But let's not ban what could be one of our strongest selling points without even giving them a try first!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="17" LastEditDate="2017-06-27T11:31:41.597" LastActivityDate="2017-06-27T11:31:41.597" CommentCount="6" />

Very much so.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why are they good?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reading-order questions are possibly the most practically useful questions this site will ever see. Questions about literary analysis, or plot points in specific works of literature, can be very interesting, and may well be the types of question that attract the &lt;em&gt;experts&lt;/em&gt; every SE site wants to have; but learning the best order in which to read a particular series of books can be vital information for someone who's just getting into that series. By providing good answers to reading-order questions, Literature SE can actually make a difference to people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My claim that these are likely to be the most useful is supported by the quantitative &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; that on what Literature is likely to consider a sister site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scifi.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Science Fiction &amp;amp; Fantasy&lt;/a&gt; (currently the only SE site which takes questions about any fiction books), suggested order questions are nearly always the &lt;strong&gt;most viewed questions in each tag&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/1520/31394&quot;&gt;In what order should the Star Wars movies be watched?&lt;/a&gt; - with over 1 million views, by far the most popular question on the entire site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/37689/31394&quot;&gt;In which order should I start watching Star Trek?&lt;/a&gt; - the most viewed question in the Star Trek tag.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/15084/31394&quot;&gt;How should I overlap the viewing of Doctor Who and Torchwood?&lt;/a&gt; - the most viewed question in the Doctor Who tag.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/10009/31394&quot;&gt;What order should the Babylon 5 movies and series be watched in?&lt;/a&gt; - the highest-scoring and &lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt; most viewed question in the Babylon 5 tag.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so on, and so forth. I could post a dozen of these. Admittedly all of the above links refer to films or TV shows rather than book series, but unfortunately most of the most popular questions on SFF &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; about screen works. For one final example, book-related and with a dose of irony:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/15841/31394&quot;&gt;What order should the Chronicles of Narnia books be read in?&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most viewed questions in the Narnia tag, &lt;em&gt;migrated from the original Literature SE&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; they bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me also take some time to address what I suspect will be people's main argument &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; allowing these questions: subjectivity. This is always going to be seen as a potential issue with suggested order questions. In fact, one of the most natural titles for such questions, &quot;What's the best order to read such-and-such a series?&quot;, contains the buzzword &quot;best&quot; which will raise an automatic notification that your question may be closed for being too subjective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;subjective questions aren't always bad!&lt;/strong&gt; In an old blog post entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;&quot;Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which is still cited in every site's &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&quot;&gt;help centre&lt;/a&gt; to this day, SE employee Robert Cartaino discussed what can make subjective questions a great fit for the SE model. To summarise a lot of words, they should attract answers which are &lt;em&gt;detailed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;impartial&lt;/em&gt;, actually &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;, and most importantly of all &lt;em&gt;well explained and supported&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for reading-order questions? Well, clearly an answer should be more than just &quot;read the books in this order&quot; or &quot;here's the order I read them in&quot; - such minimalist answers should be downvoted. A really good answer should not only give a suggested reading order but also some &lt;strong&gt;objective supporting evidence&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; that particular order is recommended. Explain that reading book A will give you major spoilers for the ending of book B, or that book C only makes sense when you already know the events of book A, or anything else that makes a good argument for one order rather than another. If the author of the series is on record as recommending a particular order, that can also be good supporting information.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;By voting responsibly on answers to reading-order questions, we can discourage low-quality ones from being posted and encourage good ones to be recognised. In time, Literature SE can become &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; go-to place for anyone starting on a new book series with a non-obvious order who wants to know where to begin!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2017-01-18T17:50:37.893" CommentCount="9" />

Like those slivers of carrot, such questions can potentially give answerers &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to chew on while they're waiting for the meat...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;strong&gt;But you still gotta have plenty of meat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last time we tried this, we ended up with mostly bland vegetables: ID questions, reading lists, etc. Folks enthusiastically defended them, until they realized that they were bored and so was everyone else; the site was shut down because pretty much &lt;em&gt;everyone left&lt;/em&gt;. There was no traffic, no new thought-provoking questions or meaty topics... Just an increasingly dusty pile of limp trivia that had been chewed on and spat out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this site gets a tiny handful of ID questions, just enough to fill in the gaps between more interesting and useful questions, they'll probably be fine. But if a majority of questions fall into this category, it becomes quite unlikely that the site will survive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, let's be honest: if the site takes off, y'all will want to get rid of ID questions anyway simply because when there's &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of meat they're a distraction, keeping them around doesn't help anyone, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2467/can-we-get-some-more-definitive-numbers-on-identification-request-stats&quot;&gt;the folks who ask them don't stick around to help anyone else&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;But what about all those other site where ID questions are so popular?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mean SciFi &amp;amp; Fantasy. Yeah, they do ID questions. Here's a graph of the percentage of questions asked each month that are ID questions, for the entire history of SFF:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0nBF.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0nBF.png&quot; alt=&quot;it has never been over 30%&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This includes deleted questions) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two things you should note there:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly the first &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt; of the site's life, they kept the percentage of ID questions below 20, and most months there would've been around 9 non-ID questions for every single ID question - even less during the first month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They've &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; had more than 30% ID questions in a given month. Not a single month in the history of the site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with sites like Anime or Movies, where ID questions quickly became the &lt;em&gt;majority of questions being asked on the site&lt;/em&gt;, and you can start to understand why SFF can afford to take a more &lt;em&gt;laissez faire&lt;/em&gt; approach here; their diet is still mostly meat, while the other sites dealing with these questions are looking over hungrily from their big heaping plates of napa cabbage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;So... what &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; y'all take away from this?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to go out of your way to shut down ID questions as soon as they spring up, as long as they're rare and well-written. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you're reading this, it's probably a bad idea for you to ask them yourself; if you want to help this site grow, give its members wholesome food to chew on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if, in a week or two, you survey the site and see an awful lot of ID questions...

You need to have the same kind of mind to be interested in either topic. I think we can help each other grow quite a lot. Mythology isn't graduated yet, so it doesn't have community promotion ads and can't add one for Literature, but I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34859583#34859583&quot;&gt;users there will quickly become aware&lt;/a&gt; of Literature's presence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="71" LastEditorUserId="71" LastEditDate="2017-01-18T20:31:00.940" LastActivityDate="2017-01-18T20:31:00.940" CommentCount="0" />

It's not a vague recommendation question where you have to guess what book will please me, I give specific criteria.  If you have a volume in your hand, and you think it might be an answer for this question, you can tell whether it is by checking that it's a Hungarian translation of one of those novels, it is not any of the old translations I've identified, not an abridged edition half as long as the usual versions, and you can check that the illustrations are the ones I asked for by comparing them to the images I linked to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think the question has too many possible answers.

To take your example, I'm interested in the &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; series but am not fluent in Polish, so whether it's been translated into English is a fairly important question for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As b_jonas notes in comments, these questions have &lt;strong&gt;lasting value&lt;/strong&gt;: if there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an existing translation, it won't suddenly disappear, and if there &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt;, that answer will stand until someone creates one (which isn't likely to happen overnight).

Both of which are correct though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet it is so basic, that there isn't really anything to say besides quoting the thousandfold available story from a wiki or quoting the source directly—which is of course better, but my copy wasn't around. So as long as we embrace such basic questions we have to embrace quote only answers for those. The more important lesson is maybe not regarding quality, but regarding triviality. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trivial questions beget trivial answers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Short and simple and even low effort questions can be intriguing.

The answer however skips the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; completely. It offers no explanation if the cough is supposed to be a plot device, or a literary device or if there's any other relevance to it. Essentially it's one of the really bad FGITW answers. That's why I proudly down voted because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; one answers with a quote it should at least answer the question. That should always be the bare minimum.

In the example you've highlighted, the answers seem to boil down to &quot;because Nazis and socialism.&quot; &lt;em&gt;That's not a complete answer to the question.&lt;/em&gt; Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/27/80&quot;&gt;the top answer&lt;/a&gt; (at the time of writing this question) just gives a well-referenced answer to sources that, themselves, don't bother going below the surface of why these books were banned. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/26/80&quot;&gt;The second answer&lt;/a&gt; (again, at the time of writing) (now) hits the nail on the head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A true answer to the question about why a book is banned needs to consider a lot of information that may not be readily available from a couple quick searches. A thorough answer should consider the sociopolitical climate that caused the banning, at a level deeper than &quot;it's pro-socialist.&quot; It should consider what &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; content of the books led to it being banned (because usually there's something in particular), and whether the reasons for its banning line up with what the author was trying to communicate at all. It needs to consider whether the message was correctly received, or whether there were ulterior motives for doing so. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, books aren't typically banned &lt;em&gt;just because they espouse a political view.&lt;/em&gt; There are very few times in history when broad swaths of literature end up banned for what they represent (and even those demonstrate deeper cultural points worth discussing). Thinking about it in that way leaves a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; problematic open question: &lt;em&gt;why that book in particular?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reference to the specific &lt;em&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; example, existing answers are missing a lot of context about why, specifically, Call of the Wild was banned. What about that book led to it being banned? Why did they find it so objectionable? Why was it selected and categorized in a way that led to its banning? Why was it noticed at all? If you just Google the answer, you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Not only have objections been raised here, the book was banned in Italy, Yugoslavia and burned in bonfires in Nazi Germany in the late 1920s and early 30s because it was considered “too radical.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bannedbooksweek.org/censorship/bannedbooksthatshapedamerica&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;(source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a bad answer, and we both know it. (Who considered it &quot;too radical&quot;? Why did they think it was radical? Why is &quot;too radical&quot; in quotes, anyway - did someone actually write or say that?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second challenge to the frame of your question is more structural in a Stack Exchangeian way. It's not necessarily true that easily-Googleable questions are bad here. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/116/should-we-embrace-non-googlers&quot;&gt;Should we embrace non-Googlers?&lt;/a&gt; is worth a read. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What it boils down to, though, is this: &lt;strong&gt;if we can reasonably give a better answer than Google can, we should accept the question, so that we can take advantage of the opportunity to do so.&lt;/strong&gt; If we can't, then I agree, it's a waste of our time to try to answer. However, I hope I've shown above that, in the case of censored literature, we do indeed have the ability and opportunity to do so, if given the chance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope I've been able to change your view about the actual complexity of questions about why literature ends up banned, and I hope that this answer helps situate these questions as squarely on-topic. However, if not, that's okay, too! At minimum, I hope I've given some food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2017-01-21T21:49:41.940" CommentCount="7" />

A medium-sized novel may have several underlying themes which run through the entire work, plus many which only crop up occasionally, or which could be argued to appear only under some interpretations. A thorough answer would have to cover every theme that &lt;em&gt;may possibly&lt;/em&gt; appear in the book, discuss the arguments for and against that really being a theme of the story, and then do all the work described in the previous paragraph for each of these themes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, it sounds like a textbook example of &lt;strong&gt;Too Broad&lt;/strong&gt;: not because there are &quot;too many possible answers&quot;, but because &quot;&lt;strong&gt;good answers would be too long for this format&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.

And hey, guess what Stack Exchange used to say about new sites?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t shout out a calculus question in a football stadium, right? You’d go to the math department of a university. That’s why instead of allowing questions on any topic, we have brought together separate communities of experts on very specific topics. We don’t open a site until we’re sure there’s a critical mass of experts ready to participate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though Stack Exchange no longer says that, &quot;Literature&quot; Stack Exchange isn't really made for us. The word &lt;em&gt;Literature&lt;/em&gt; implies &lt;em&gt;expert discourse,&lt;/em&gt; all by its lonesome. Stack Exchange is designed with this principle in mind: &quot;&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; experts, &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; experts,&quot; to hold expert-level discourse. That was the slogan. Although SE, nearly everywhere, no longer does what it was explicitly designed to do, and SE has dialed back on the &quot;experts&quot; phrasing, the design of the Stack still reflects it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to draw a crude, ugly false-dichotomy-circle in neon yellow chalk around who's the audience of this-here-site. But bear with me, because it's actually a spectrum, and there are most certainly two ends to it. Or four. A square? (Whatever.) On the one side, we have &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;. The current users of this site. On the other side, we have &lt;em&gt;experts.&lt;/em&gt; These are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the current users of this site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the one side, the site can appeal to &lt;em&gt;us, the current users, directly&lt;/em&gt;. On the other side, the site can appeal to &lt;em&gt;real experts.&lt;/em&gt; We're not these experts (and frankly, I think we're all feeling a little in over our heads); however, &lt;em&gt;we &lt;strong&gt;can try&lt;/strong&gt; to raise discourse to an expert level,&lt;/em&gt; and set a tone where those experts will be a welcome gift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing. I come from Puzzling. Long, long ago, when I was far more naively idealistic, and with the support of not-too-many-but-not-zero-people, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://puzzling.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1601/is-it-time-for-us-to-disallow-challenge-only-questions&quot;&gt;tried &lt;em&gt;really, really hard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (score: +30/-31) to guide the site toward expert-level discussion of how to approach puzzles, how to design them, what goes on in someone's mind, how to make them appealing... you name it. At the time, my feelings were this: if we couldn't be an expert site, the site shouldn't exist. We were deeply confused about &lt;a href=&quot;https://puzzling.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1466/20&quot;&gt;what we wanted the site to be.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My feelings have changed slightly, and anyone who's seen the site knows that a site by experts for experts is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what we got. I'm not complaining - this doesn't make the site &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. Alright, fine, it's still a site that purports to be for experts while actually being for enthusiasts, but when it comes to puzzles and games, that's not really a problem. (Plus, with puzzles, the threshold to find expertise is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; lower; we made &lt;em&gt;our own&lt;/em&gt; experts.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But here, it's a problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Literature, literary thinking, and literary critique are &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. Harder than you or I think. All the discussions around &quot;what constitutes literature?&quot; exemplify this in droves. All the discussions treating literary lenses like opinions and analysis in a &quot;you-decide&quot; sort of way exemplify this. Most of us have no training in any sort of formal critical analysis, or are at least unpracticed, struggle to keep it straight in our heads, and are scooting along with our butts on the floor trying to answer questions of broad depth and meaning. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That includes me. There's no way I'm an exception here. (I'm 20, I'm still at an age where spending a few &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt; on a problem is considered &quot;a very long time.&quot;) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we can't really put on a facade of a site that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/tour&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;by experts, for experts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if we can't provide the sort of high-quality, detailed answers that an &quot;expert&quot; site needs to be built upon. So the decision is this: &lt;strong&gt;do we, or do we not, want to be a site for literature &lt;em&gt;experts&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; You and I might not &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; these experts, but if we work at it, we can raise the discourse to expert level, pushing people to make more detailed, thorough, and insightful answers - and in the future, we might reach the level of &quot;expert.&quot; Or we could... not. And that's okay, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're not the only site with this problem, either. I'm only going to touch on it briefly, because that's its own thorny issue, but Worldbuilding &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3033/is-worldbuilding-a-what-if-site&quot;&gt;has faced a similar problem&lt;/a&gt;. There's a common opinion that Worldbuilding became much more of a website for amateur (&quot;armchair&quot;) speculation, rather than a site about professional consideration of the issues of worldbuilding. Somewhere down the line, Worldbuilding forgot about &lt;em&gt;experts-first site building&lt;/em&gt;, and that's a very similar place to where we're potentially headed. The end result is that Worldbuilding &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4260/have-any-answers-made-it-into-published-fiction&quot;&gt;does not seem to be performing its surface-level function&lt;/a&gt;: allowing &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; worldbuilding experts to help each other build worlds. (Be it known that I think this is a &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; issue with the way Stack Exchange launches sites at all, more than it is reflective of our &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; case.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an issue that touches every single thing the site does, and will do, from the time it was launched until the heat death of the universe. How we vote, how we post, what we close, what we keep, whether poetry or music or the structure of music and games or polycultural questions or oral tradition are on topic - &lt;em&gt;all these things&lt;/em&gt; are determined by the sort of site we want to be. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/283/is-this-site-focused-on-literature-analysis-or-literature-in-general&quot;&gt;Want&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/282/what-kinds-of-mythological-questions-are-on-topic&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67/are-songs-and-poems-on-topic&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/should-graphic-novels-be-on-topic&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/188/are-operas-considered-literature-on-this-site&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/103/should-we-allow-questions-about-a-literary-works-impact-on-the-language&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/should-we-allow-questions-about-religious-texts&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/219/how-big-a-role-should-quotes-play-in-answers&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/should-we-allow-questions-about-religious-texts&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141/what-types-of-non-fiction-are-on-topic&quot;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt;. Each decidable based almost &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; on this philosophical question. (There's a deeper issue here, where many people don't seem to clearly grasp what it is literary analysts actually do and study, but that's a problem for another time.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm not going to say which one is better or worse.&lt;/strong&gt; But as I view it, we have two options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We can keep the name Literature Stack Exchange, and do our best to elevate the level of discourse to the heights we'd hope to see from experts in the field. You and I are not the &lt;em&gt;experts&lt;/em&gt; this version needs, but we can work and work hard to raise the level of discourse up to this point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We can rename the site to something like &lt;em&gt;Books SE&lt;/em&gt; for discussion of bound printed matter, keep all the poetry and lyrics, and occasionally, maybe field a literary question, acknowledging that it's being answered from the perspective of enthusiasts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But (here comes the false dichotomy; ready? seat-belts buckled?) we can't do both. If we stick with &quot;Books,&quot; even in spirit, we're going to lose the experts at critical analysis. (And I'm quite serious about changing the name of the site, don't get me wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do need to make a rough decision, though, about where in this we want to lie. This isn't a straightforward issue, but it definitely is pressing, and for the health of the site from here on out, it needs to be handled before it crystallizes beneath our feet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T16:44:26.520" LastActivityDate="2017-11-06T00:01:56.890" Title="Who are the experts?

And let me say this: what you've brought up is something that they've all faced, in some form or another, as they came into this world &lt;strike&gt;kicking and screaming&lt;/strike&gt; along with a bunch of us who had no &lt;em&gt;clue&lt;/em&gt; where we were going. I've seen Law, Mythology, Engineering, Latin Language, and a few others try to overcome the hurdle and make it across in decent shape, and Open Science trip and fall flat on its face because it couldn't make the jump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm wracking my brain for an exact source for who said the following, but in lieu of that, here's a paraphrasing of what a wise person - it might have been Shog9 - once said:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange is a bunch of programmers coding and then cooking and gardening and writing and playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very format of Stack Exchange, the fact that it's on the Internet, caters to those who use computers every day, and the best group for that are the programmers. They'll be coding and debugging and compiling and then they hit a bug, and suddenly the Internet beckons, and it leads them to a quick solution. So they're very likely to come across Stack Exchange in the first place&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and even more likely than others to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrast them to, say, the guys at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Old_House&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This Old House&lt;/a&gt;, or at the mechanic's, or at a restaurant, or in a college math department. These folks are much less likely to find out about Stack Exchange in the first place. This means that, given that a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fraction of Stack Exchange users are programmers, new sites are rapidly populated by those who are only enthusiasts in &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, and so &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; Stack Exchange can very easily become led by them. On most sites I participate on, &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; one of them (lest you think that I'm shaking my finger at you all).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is, it's very, very hard to get a number of self-described &quot;experts&quot; on any new Stack Exchange site. Impossible? Oh, not by any means. But you're never going to have a beta site populated just by said experts. I'll stake my account on that. So let's get over the idea that we're ever going to have any significant number of them on Literature Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, but is this a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Out of those eleven private betas I've been in, exactly one has failed, and that was Open Science. That one had a complicated start, to say the least, and perhaps anyone else who was there might agree with me that it may actually have suffered from a lack of . . . well, enough people who knew a significant amount about the subject. But the others are still going strong, last time I checked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a certain perspective, I want to ask why that's the case. Maybe Robert Cartaino can give you a better answer, but my view is that they, as a whole, understood what it took me a while to figure out: sites &lt;em&gt;grow&lt;/em&gt;, and their users do, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've asked some stupid questions in my time on Stack Exchange. Naïve, ignorant, foolish - call them what you will. Today, I like to think that the questions I ask are just a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; less stupid. I've learned, from asking and answering and trying and failing and getting back up and falling on my bum and asking again. My questions on Astronomy today are probably better than the ones I asked 30 months ago (in my view).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert - in anything (yet). And I think I'm not alone. But I'm closer to getting to the point where I can ask intelligent questions in a bunch of areas, and, once in a while, answer some. The same goes for a lot of other people. By engaging in the kind of discourse we do on Stack Exchange, we'll &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; how to be better at literary analysis, just by trying and failing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I'm saying is that we should step back for a second and let the site evolve how it will. We are going to ask stupid questions and ask stupid answers, because we don't know everything, and we never will. But we'll all get better, and you know what? Once we get to the point where we've become skilled enough to answer these questions a little bit like experts, I can sit down, exhale, and think that we've done what we needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Worldbuilding&lt;/a&gt; has a few problems, and why Literature likely won't.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Worldbuilding moderator here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You've identified what I think the main problem is - and has been - on Worldbuilding Stack Exchange for a while, namely, that everyone has an opinion on everything and therefore a variety of questions are asked and answered like there's no tomorrow (if I can paraphrase you like that). That is an issue, and one that we've tried to fix in a few different ways, such as encouraging downvoting and trying to get more rigorous responses to certain questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My best explanation is that information is all around us, and yet it's the wrong kind of information. There are so many popular articles around us on a bazillion topics - science, history, linguistics, and so on. People can peruse some of those, and then when a question on that subject comes up, they try to answer it. Boom! You get problems, because folks aren't conscious of what they don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think we're going to see the same issues here. If you can piece together a half-decent answer to a question on Literature, you've at least read the book in full, in all likelihood. Therefore, you've looked at the information &lt;em&gt;in some sort of context&lt;/em&gt;, rather than just a few misrepresented points on an article in &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;. Now, you may not have understood the material in the same way someone trained in literary analysis might. However, you're a good portion of the way there, because you've read the actual thing, not just a summary of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's no guarantee that people can't write answers without having read the whole book or poem or piece of literature. However, it's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; harder to write a half-decent answer if you haven't. A lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Granted, this is because Stack Overflow is so popular, but still, you get the idea.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="71" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:52:35.397" LastActivityDate="2017-01-31T02:12:55.630" CommentCount="5" />

We, the current userbase of this site, are not 'experts' - in the sense that (as far as I know) none of us are literature professors, or even have degrees in literature; none of us have jobs in libraries; none of us are &lt;em&gt;professionally&lt;/em&gt; involved with literature.

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert#Use_in_literature&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Malcolm Gladwell&lt;/a&gt;, it's a person with 10,000 hours of practice. Well, I must have spent more than 10,000 hours of my life reading, and I'm sure I'm not the only one here who has. We all have different knowledge bases and skill sets, but we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have knowledge about literature, and skill in discussing and writing about it. Let's not knock ourselves here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What does Stack Exchange want from experts?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You've talked a lot about Stack Exchange attracting experts, but it seems to me that what it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sells itself on is &lt;strong&gt;expert answers&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Expert&quot; as an adjective, not as a noun. As usual on Stack Exchange, it's the content that matters, rather than the people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following two possible answers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/1/17&quot;&gt;the same question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, Svidrigailov definitely committed murder in &lt;em&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/em&gt;. I know this because I have spent years studying the novel and written a dissertation and two books on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-- Prof. A. N. Expert, BA MA PhD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehKGlT2EW1Q&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;etc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, Svidrigailov definitely committed murder in &lt;em&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/em&gt;. We can deduce this from a careful analysis of the text, as follows. In Chapter 17, Svidrigailov says: [...] Furthermore, it stands to reason from his behaviour in Chapter 23 that [...] There have also been some academic papers written on this issue. &lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;One of them&lt;/a&gt; argues that [...] because [...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-- user2873, Literature SE&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't need me to tell you which of those two answers we'd rather see here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why am I saying all this? Because it shows that &lt;strong&gt;what matters is the quality of answers, not who posts them&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, let's not knock ourselves. We're perfectly capable of conducting critical analysis of literary texts ourselves, and writing up well-reasoned conclusions thoughtfully and at length. We don't need 'experts' to help us - we can become our own experts!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned Puzzling SE. Well, you and I have both seen how that site has changed and grown over the years, and - as you say - how it's gathered its own 'home grown' experts. &lt;em&gt;That's not a Puzzling-specific phenomenon.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We can all be experts, if we're willing to put in the time and effort and learn from our peers.&lt;/strong&gt; That's not to say we are experts at this stage, or that we'll ever be as knowledgeable as an average literature professor. Let's face it, we are basically enthusiasts with no real qualifications, and we're going to muck up a lot. But we can get much better at this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, anyone who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a professional or 'expert' will be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than welcome to participate here! Nobody will be happier than me to see an actual literature professor become an active user here, but we can't rely on that ever happening. I suspect most Stack Exchange sites, except perhaps those very specifically geared towards programmers and other computer people, are like this: the occasional professional whom people can &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2474/31394&quot;&gt;ooh and aah&lt;/a&gt; over, but mostly enthusiasts producing expert content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;We might not be the heroes Literature SE deserves, but we're the heroes it needs right now.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site is at an early stage. We're still finding our feet. But I've been mightily impressed with some of the content here so far - long, well-thought-out essays with detailed deconstructions and analyses. That stuff gets upvotes. &lt;em&gt;That's how it should be.&lt;/em&gt; We're already producing 'expert' content - let's just keep on going in a similar vein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not to say the content so far is the best it could be. Most of us are relatively inexperienced, and there's always room for improvement. Probably none of the posts we have so far match up to the standards we might expect from professional literary critics, but we have all the time in the world to make that improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as we &lt;strong&gt;keep our minds open, and are willing to accept criticism and learn from each other&lt;/strong&gt;, we can keep on improving forever.

You don't necessarily need expert people to create expert content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the very idea of attracting expert people here may be a bit pie-in-the-sky anyway. Imagine you were a literature professor - would you want to spend your spare time frittering around on Stack Exchange answering people's questions about literature in a way that fits into this company's Q&amp;amp;A system? &lt;em&gt;Probably not.&lt;/em&gt; Like I said &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26001/how-can-we-avoid-friction-with-scifi-se#comment39705_26072&quot;&gt;way back on Area 51&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There aren't enough literature professors on the internet to keep an entire Stack Exchange site running.

But even though that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the direction it seems to be heading in (and I'm personally &lt;em&gt;very happy&lt;/em&gt; about that - most of my favourite posts on SFF have been basically literary analysis, rather than quotes and links which could be Googled up by anyone), my point still stands. Fortunately, though, it doesn't really matter: with enough determination, open-mindedness, and will to succeed, we can do all that's needed our very own selves.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR: let's be enthusiasts producing expert content, and create our very own community of experts.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-03T08:41:05.823" LastActivityDate="2017-01-28T18:25:31.230" CommentCount="5" />

It sounds like people are feeling intimidated. People think that literature is about words like &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/608/how-much-weight-is-given-to-authors-intentions-in-literary-analysis#comment1239_608&quot;&gt;New Criticism, postmodernism, structuralism&lt;/a&gt;, and that it's out of most people's reach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality, literary analysis isn't that hard. For example, let's look at a literary analysis question that I asked recently: &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/493/111&quot;&gt;Why does Robert Frost contradict himself in “The Road Not Taken”&lt;/a&gt;. This literary analysis question was very easy to ask. I just found a part of the poem where its meaning was unclear, and just asked a question about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answering literary analysis questions shouldn't be that hard either. For the purposes of this site, all literary analysis should involve is looking at a story, putting it in its societal/historic context, and then determining possible meanings of that text. The answers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/873/111&quot;&gt;What is Jack&amp;#39;s crown?&lt;/a&gt; do a pretty good job of this -- three possible meanings are presented in three answers. The fact that questions can have more than one answer can be confusing, but that's why literary analysis is interesting in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although experts would be nice, we don't necessarily need them to have interesting (but admittedly not expert-level) discussions about literary analysis. What we do need is &lt;em&gt;interest&lt;/em&gt; in asking and answering these questions. Is there interest in these questions? If there is interest, then we should all make a collective effort to ask and attempt to answer these types of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about literary analysis, &lt;a href=&quot;http://taxicrash.github.io/2017/01/24/literary-analysis-examples/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;I've started collecting freely available links on my blog&lt;/a&gt;.

However, for questions about literature in more niche languages like Japanese that I've seen already, I'd consider adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/written-in-japanese&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;written-in-japanese&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;written-in-japanese&lt;/a&gt; tag or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/japanese-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;japanese-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;japanese-literature&lt;/a&gt; tag or a plain &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/japanese&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;japanese&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;japanese&lt;/a&gt; tag.

I would strongly argue that we have to go for the &quot;expert literature&quot; hat. &quot;Books SE&quot; is a weak proposition for two reasons. Firstly, it's too woolly for the Q&amp;amp;A format in my opinion and is likely to turn into a morass of opinionated nonsense. Second, much of what might not become a morass of opinionated nonsense is already covered by sites like Mythology and Fantasy and others. We've already discussed that we may have clashing problems with other SE sites. &lt;strong&gt;We need a clear differentiation, and that ought to be &quot;expert&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I am surprised by the claims here that there are almost no &quot;experts&quot; involved with this site. I have studied literature at university, although only to first-year undergraduate level. I chose &quot;avid enthusiast&quot; at the sign up because a few undergrad modules are no real claim to expertise. If you're all correct about the education of the other users in the private beta, &lt;strong&gt;that makes me one of the most qualified people here&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I doubt that is true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I doubt it is that the quality of many of the questions and answers seems pretty high to me. Many contributors are already offering content way beyond anything I could hope to give. Now, if I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; one of the most qualified people here, that means they past the test of &quot;expertise&quot;. If, as seems likely, I am not, that means, well, that there are more qualified people here. &lt;strong&gt;Either way, we pass a certain bar of quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What seems to me to be a far bigger problem is hinted at by the large number of unanswered questions. I studied Joseph Conrad, TS Eliot, Tolkien and Shakespeare among others and have tried to ask and answer some questions based on that study. But that is a very narrow view into &quot;literature&quot;. And this is a peculiar thing about literature and about art generally: broad knowledge is of limited value. If you want to answer meaningfully about a given work, you need to know the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, for someone to offer regular contributions to an &quot;expert literature&quot; SE they will have to have read a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of books. It is likely that the only people who read enough and understand enough about classic literature are indeed full-time students and academics in the subject. &lt;strong&gt;In order to get and maintain enough quality content here we will either need some of these specialists or we will need a much bigger and broader user base.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the same is the same is true of maths. Yet we have a Maths SE, which is precisely for academics and enthusiasts. And it's spawned a Maths Education SE which is even more specialist, yet thriving. &lt;strong&gt;These communities, in this format are of enormous use to academics and students&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone coming here and using it for themselves will quickly be convinced of that. But we do need to try and gather the users and make some active inroads if we can. People who are active on other academic SE's could perhaps put word round their colleagues when we become public. Perhaps since we've built it, they will come. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In essence then: we ought to be &quot;expert&quot;, the idea is sound, but one way or another we're going to need a bigger user base.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastActivityDate="2017-01-27T17:28:53.043" CommentCount="0" />

Someone can have expert knowledge without actually being an acknowledged expert. I agree with the sentiment expressed in other answers here: I don't care if the person who answers my question is a world-famous professor of literature or a janitor who reads a lot while waiting for the floors to dry, as long as the answer is composed at an expert level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The majority of my network-wide SE reputation comes from my account on Anime and Manga, so Anime and Manga is my home site insofar as I have one. I also spend a fair amount of time lurking on Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and frankly much of the content I see there is higher quality than what we have on Anime and Manga. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally realized that Sci-Fi and Fantasy has better content than Anime and Manga because they have a few big, complex universes—Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, and DC and Marvel Comics—that everyone concentrates all the attention on. Anime and Manga has a gap between the works that hardcore fans like and more populist, accessible stuff, so it's developed these weird little sub-communities around a few series, with a long tail of questions about more obscure shows that never get answered or get lazy one-line wiki copy-and-paste answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of these questions are very interesting and deep, and every so often, one of them gets an answer which is very interesting and deep. Some of it even reaches what I'd like to see Literature move towards: &lt;strong&gt;insightful commentary on symbolism, intertextuality, historical and cultural context, story structure, and character motivation.&lt;/strong&gt; As one example I'll point you towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/15130/about-the-artworks-used-in-the-elfen-lied-opening-scenes-contains-nudity&quot;&gt;About the artworks used in the Elfen Lied opening scenes (contains nudity)&lt;/a&gt;, which explains how the images from the opening scenes of a not-very-good sci-fi action anime are actually references to paintings by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Klimt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gustave Klimt&lt;/a&gt;, and unravels the symbolism which weaves the content of these paintings into the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, because Anime and Manga has so few people capable of writing such content, and so many shows dividing those people's attention, it's not common to see this sort of thing. I want to stress that &lt;strong&gt;questions at that level are also in short supply&lt;/strong&gt;; most of the questions we get are the usual &quot;Why did So-and-so do this?&quot;, &quot;What's this Japanese pun mean?&quot;, etc. Not bad questions, but not deep or insightful. It's usually hard to write a deep answer to a shallow question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of these represent potential futures for Literature: we could become like Sci-Fi and Fantasy and concentrate all of our attention on just a few big works, or we could become like Anime and Manga and have a large populist class talking about a few big works while a small elite lingers in the background, shooting questions about whatever their current interest is off into the night and hoping to hit someone with the knowledge to answer them. &lt;strong&gt;Both of these futures are undesirable to me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like Literature to be more like Anime and Manga than Sci-Fi and Fantasy in this sense: given the vast scope of literature in the world (even if you restrict the scope to written narrative works without significant visual or aural content), &lt;strong&gt;I hope we won't end up a site that focuses around just &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, the Sherlock Holmes stories, and Orwell.&lt;/strong&gt; Those are all good stories, but they're just a tiny fraction of what the world of literature has to offer. This is going pretty well so far. I've seen questions on Borges, Whitman, Eliot, Faulkner, and Plath, and my question on William Blake got a pretty good answer faster than I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even more so, I would like Literature to surpass both SF&amp;amp;F and A&amp;amp;M in that whatever work we're talking about, &lt;strong&gt;we focus more on sophisticated inquiry and less on surface-level plot or trivia questions.&lt;/strong&gt; It's not that those are bad or wrong questions, but they're not questions that get me fired up to go read something. Knowing that (made-up example) Baron Finklestein didn't just send a telegram because, as one of his servants mentioned in Chapter 3, the year was 1816 and the telegraph was not invented until 1844, I don't feel any urge to go read this story and I am not edified. But finding out that a story makes brilliant use of symbolism or employs an interesting plot structure leaves an impression in my mind, and might induce me to go read it if I haven't, or deepen my appreciation for it if I have. &lt;strong&gt;I think our current crowd of users has people who are capable of reaching this level, but we've seen it less because the site is still finding its feet.&lt;/strong&gt; If we need a bit of snobbery to accomplish this, at least it's snobbery well applied instead of for its own sake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;I don't think we need to strive for the PhD crowd as our sole audience.&lt;/strong&gt; My motive for saying so is entirely selfish: I'm not a PhD, and in fact am not very smart at all. I put &quot;Beginner or Learner&quot; on my commitment message. I was an English major my first year at university, and two semesters of English literature plus some rainy afternoons in the back of the library is my only training in literary criticism. I'm way too dumb to answer questions on this site even as it exists now. But every so often, I plunge in and read some Blake, or some Wordsworth, or some Shakespeare, or some Marquez, or some Wodehouse, and I have aspirations to someday read something by Thomas Pynchon and something by Vladimir Nabokov. When I do, I have questions that I'm too dumb to answer, that go beyond surface plot details. I'm hoping this will be a place I can ask them, but if every such question is greeted by a sound of crickets, I'm going to stop bringing them, just like I stopped bringing anything beyond &quot;explain this pun&quot; to Anime and Manga. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a postscript, I'll comment on the scope issues. &lt;strong&gt;My main desire is that Literature become a place where questions about symbolism, language use, cultural and historical context, story structure, etc. get good answers, no matter what work they're asking about.&lt;/strong&gt; If we have to eschew peripheral things like songs and graphic novels to get there, then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;if we can reasonably include those peripheral things, I think we should,&lt;/strong&gt; because there are indeed academics who study them in English and literature departments. A professor from the English department at the university I attended is a world-recognized expert on &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; and runs an upper-division class on graphic novels covering work such as &lt;em&gt;Maus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persepolis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt;. (I had the opportunity to take it even though it was way, way outside my major, and I squandered it.) The site can be large enough to include these works, but there is a danger that they'll take over and that the discourse on them won't reach an adequate level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:54:51.657" LastActivityDate="2017-01-28T18:39:58.960" CommentCount="4" />

Their utility is obvious, but generally speaking, these are the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of expert questions. These are (usually) trivialities and everybody-can-answer questions. On a more active site with wider scope (e.g. SciFi), these questions might be a mere nuisance in my own opinion, but when they seem like the primary focus of the site, they drown it out.

Sure, there are a few SFF people who can't be bothered to participate here because the only fiction they read is sci-fi and fantasy, but there are also plenty who've happily joined up here and are helping to build this site too. SFF and &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/a&gt; have coped for years with having scope overlap without either site collapsing. Furthermore, so far it looks as though the 'tone' of this site - the style of questions and answers encouraged here - is shaping up to be very different from SFF's (again, I can elaborate on this if anyone wants me to), which means that although many literary works could be asked about on either site, the types of question asked may differ between here and SFF, which reduces the 'competition' for content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/q/22392/124276&quot;&gt;How can we make this literature proposal succeed when other literature proposals have failed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The top answer, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/111/hamlet&quot;&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;, says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, I think the problem is a lack of effort. While the &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/80865/literature&quot;&gt;last literature proposal&lt;/a&gt; had 89 followers, it also only had 45 example questions (many of which were downvoted and/or closed). In order for a proposal to succeed, it needs 40 questions that have 10 or more upvotes. Therefore, I would encourage everyone to ask five example questions. If you don't have time to create an original example question, you can copy questions from &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/80865/literature&quot;&gt;the old literature proposal&lt;/a&gt; or from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6426/literature&quot;&gt;old literature site&lt;/a&gt; (which was closed back when Stack Exchange &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257614/160606&quot;&gt;had different standards about site activity&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And of course, I would also encourage everyone to promote this site on other Stack Exchange sites, on other online communities, and among people whom you personally know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let's make this proposal a success!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; In response to questions I have received about the closure of the formal literature site, I'm going to briefly discuss why that site was closed. In my opinion, the site was closed for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stated, earlier, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/04/when-a-site-grows-quiet/&quot;&gt;old literature site was closed&lt;/a&gt; back when &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257614/160606&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange had different standards for about site activity for beta sites&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, those standards no longer apply to beta sites, and if this proposal eventually reached the private beta phase it wouldn't be in danger of being shut down for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason why the old literature site wasn't successful was that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/02/lets-play-the-guessing-game/&quot;&gt;it had turned into a site dedicated to book recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. People weren't asking questions about literature; they were asking questions along the line of &quot;could you recommend a book that I would enjoy to me.&quot; This problem could easily be avoided in the new site: we would just have to be proactive about closing book recommendation questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the data dump of the old literature site's meta section, I got the impression that people were confused about the scope of the site. It wasn't clear whether the site was supposed to be a book recommendation site, a site for literary analysis, or a site to answer basic plot points in works of literature. I don't think that this proposal should be a book recommendation site -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/87408/book-exchange?referrer=xX97ubMj5p_2uUvFE5sqCg2&quot;&gt;there are other proposals for that&lt;/a&gt; -- but I do think it could be successful as a combination of the second and the third topics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I am worried that there don't seem to be very many literary analysis questions on the area51 page, and since Stack Exchange originated as a programming site, I'm not sure if this proposal will attract many teachers/scholars of literature who have the expertise necessary to answer those questions. However, it certainly is worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've asked and answered many literary analysis type questions on Mythology.SE, and I would be willing to ask and answer such questions on a literature site if it was created. The question that remains is whether others would be willing (and have the expertise necessary) to do the same. I think it's worth a shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I disagree with the assertion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/131399/160606&quot;&gt;made by some people&lt;/a&gt;, that questions about literature ill suited to the Stack Exchange format. Previously in this answer, I gave examples of questions asked and answered on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mythology.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange's mythology website&lt;/a&gt; about relatively complex literary elements in mythology. I think these examples show that even complex literary analysis questions can be successful on Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How does this assessment compare with what's actually been happening in the first week and a half of our lovely shiny new site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the issue of followers and example questions has already been resolved, in order for us to get this far. (It wouldn't be boasting to say that a significant proportion of this was thanks to me. I'm active in a lot of different chatrooms, and I bugged a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people to follow the proposal and use up all their upvotes on example questions. Without that effort, who knows what would have happened.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with most of the rest of Hamlet's answer, the important points being that &lt;strong&gt;SE's standards are different now&lt;/strong&gt; (making it much less likely that we'll fail in beta), &lt;strong&gt;recommendation questions are banned now&lt;/strong&gt; (again!), &lt;strong&gt;we can mix literary analysis with trivia/plot questions&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/300/17&quot;&gt;further reading&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;strong&gt;yes, literary analysis really can work&lt;/strong&gt; (see above).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/q/25915/124276&quot;&gt;How will Literature be run different this time?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The top answer to this one is more or less the same as the answer just quoted above, so I'll skip straight to the second answer, written by myself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clearer and better site scope.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Judging from what I've read about the failure of the previous Literature site - e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/131397/why-did-literature-fail&quot;&gt;Why did Literature fail?&lt;/a&gt; - it seems that many of the problems there were due to either an unclear understanding of site scope, or an overabundance of questions which were on-topic and really shouldn't have been (e.g. recommendation questions). This time, let's be more proactive both about deciding on a clear scope and about shutting out questions that will be bad for the site. I plan to start several different scope-related meta threads as soon as private beta starts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The previous incarnation of Literature was, what, 4, 5, years ago? In that time, sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scifi.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Science Fiction and Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://anime.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Anime &amp;amp; Manga&lt;/a&gt; have grown to maturity. We can now see what a successful site based on analysis of fictional works (rather than programming, mathematics, etc.) actually looks like. Many of the followers and committers of the Literature proposal are already active on those sites. I'm a mod at SFF; you're a former mod at M&amp;TV; let's bring our experience to the table and help to make Literature great!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first of these issues isn't fully resolved, as there's still some confusion about whether various borderline questions should really be on-topic or not. Maybe it'll never be &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; resolved, but many healthy sites have Scope Wars to one extent or another. Most of the questions being posted here have never faced a single close vote, and that's heartening. Our scope debates may rage long and hard, but I'm not too worried about them destroying the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second issue is definitely an advantage. We've had active users and moderators from &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; related sites - SFF, M&amp;amp;TV, RPG, Writers, even Arqade - sharing their knowledge and experience here and helping this site to become its own newly-fledged beast, taking wisdom from many sources and yet unique and distinct from all of them.

I spent about two hours putting together a response showing that in fact, the OP had missed the depth of the poem. After my answer was posted, a few commentors claimed that the original question wasn't well-formulated. A moderator then changed the question to something else entirely. The revised question as formulated by the moderator is much more trivial; it asks for a list of literary devices used in the poem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is not the question I answered, and my answer has &lt;em&gt;nothing to do&lt;/em&gt; with the literary devices Keats used.

For precisely the reasons you state: people have invested time and effort into posts, and you can't change the meaning of the question without invalidating existing answers. A question undergoing substantial revision finds its answers ceasing to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is true whether you are a moderator, a random community member, or the person posting the question to begin with. Once you've asked the question, that's what the question is. You can clarify, but you shouldn't &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; -- if you need something new answered, the correct thing to do is open up an additional question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is questions that are ambiguous to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What is an ambiguous question?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions are ambiguous -- they could be interpreted in several different ways, or nobody's sure how to interpret them at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some typical examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions that ask more than one thing.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise you get people answering one question and not the other, and then trying to vote and compare between two answers to two different questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions that are overly broad or unclear.&lt;/strong&gt; If a question isn't really clear or specific enough to be answered, than by definition, &lt;em&gt;attempts&lt;/em&gt; to answer it are likely to confuse issues even further. Answers can't match the question if you don't know what the question &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions that participants are misunderstanding and answering the wrong thing.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe the OP thought he was being clear, but people keep latching on to some side detail and understanding that as the real question. Again, we have answers that are &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to match the question, but missing the point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions that get answers that don't seem to match the question.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if the question &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; kosher, if the answers you actually get seem not to be addressing the same question, then you've got a problem. &lt;em&gt;Whatever&lt;/em&gt; the reason, if the answers don't match the question, there's a problem here to be resolved -- maybe it's one particular poster; maybe it's a larger misunderstanding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here's the thing: All those problems we mentioned with questions being changed after they're written? With ambiguous questions, &lt;strong&gt;they're baked in at the start.&lt;/strong&gt; Because if questions and answers are mismatched, then you've &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; people spending effort on answers that aren't helpful, and people posting and getting answers that don't address their question, and good content getting deleted because eventually the question &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get focused (or closed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in these cases, &quot;Don't change the question's meaning&quot; is irrelevant. The question doesn't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; one single meaning. The question needs to be fixed -- and that might mean invalidating some answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Don't answer ambiguous questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This follows from what we've seen up until now. An ambiguous question is not aided by a good answer. An ambiguous question is aided by &lt;em&gt;closing&lt;/em&gt; it, putting in on hold, commenting for clarification, and doing whatever it takes to remove the ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;If your answer has been invalidated, re-post with an appropriate question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are still hiccups, and sometimes good content gets written that's mismatched with its question (or where the question gets closed). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simple solution for these cases is: ask a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; question, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; matched to your answer. And post your answer. Stack Exchange encourages self-answered Q&amp;amp;A. This is an awesome way to keep your work, and make the site better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, let me say a few words about the particular case at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, we had an ambiguous question. It could be read as per the title, &quot;What can you say when there's not a lot to say?&quot; -- a meta-question about writing literary criticism, using two particular poems as examples. Or it could be a very specific question -- not &quot;How would one effectively comment on writing in this specific context (of not having anything to say about it)?&quot;, but rather &quot;What comments can be made about this specific poem?&quot;. To be blunt, I read the first draft as clearly being the first of the two -- not asking specifically about &quot;To Autumn&quot; at all; merely using it as an example of a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;, of poems that have beautiful imagery but little depth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, your analysis is great, and good reading. &lt;strong&gt;That does not guarantee that it is an answer to the question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please consider: &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you had, hypothetically, misinterpreted OP's question (as could be assumed, if his clarification really had rendered your answer was irrelevant), what would that actually mean? It would mean telling OP he can't have his question answered, can't get an answer to what he actually &lt;em&gt;asked&lt;/em&gt;, because &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; misinterpreted it and spent effort on a misguided answer! That's not any good either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we rely on community moderation (that is, everybody experienced and active enough participates in moderating the site), on discussing issues as they come up, and hopefully on a healthy dose of good will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the original question was poorly framed, but you interpreted it basically correctly, and the question can be edited in a way that preserves your answer perfectly. In another case, a different solution could have been found -- such as splitting off to a new question of your own. And in all cases, we're trying to discuss issues respectfully, looking for whatever solution will leave the question, the content, the site, in the best condition possible. In the long run, that takes precedence over any one post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your question. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://writers.stackexchange.com/users/1046/standback&quot;&gt;my experience&lt;/a&gt;, ambiguously-worded questions are a significant issue on &quot;soft&quot;  Stack Exchange sites.

The term originates from theater and was applied to film because film evolved from theater, but there are no &quot;scenes&quot; to get behind with a written work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also don't think it will be that useful in the long run to use tags to distinguish between in-universe and out-of-universe questions. I can see why this might be useful on Sci-Fi and Fantasy; so many of the questions are about obscure details of elaborate fictional universes, and answers tend to assume a fully in-universe perspective unless otherwise requested, so a tag helps prevent someone showing up with an unwelcome answer from the wrong perspective. But Anime and Manga doesn't make this distinction formally, and I don't believe Movies and TV does either; if it's not clear from context, you mention in your question &quot;I'd like out-of-universe explanations please&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also find that I can't properly justify classifying subjects like symbolism or story structure as either in-universe &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; out-of-universe. They're sort of both. They can be focused solely on the text and events in the story. which are in-universe things. But they can also involve events which happened in the real world, such as historical events or events in the author's life. They're &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; out-of-universe because they're about things that the characters don't recognize or notice. They're part of the artificial superstructure of the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way it all blends together is too woolly for me to find it a useful distinction. I don't think the distinction adds anything to the Ginsberg question, for instance. The Grisham question is well-served by &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/inspiration&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;inspiration&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;. As for the Salinger question, it's exactly the kind of woolly mess I was thinking of. It's basically asking about the existence of a &quot;J.D. Salinger Literary Universe&quot;, which can be answered either in-universe (&quot;Yes, these characters and places recur in multiple stories&quot;) or out-of-universe (&quot;Yes, here's an interview where Salinger said he connected all of his stories in one universe after watching &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&quot;) or both (&quot;These characters do cross over and the places they live are real places Salinger lived that inspired his work&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastActivityDate="2017-01-29T20:45:41.510" CommentCount="0" />

(Great usernames all, btw.) I regret the somewhat belligerent tone of my question. I will accept one of the other answers eventually. But I wanted to respond to some of the points those answers have raised, and, being verbose (har har), at a length rather longer than would fit into comments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I'm aware that questions asked on SE sites are subject to revision by any user. I've been on Stack Overflow for some four years now and have revised questions, had my questions revised, and in some cases, received downvotes after the OP edited his/her question in a way that made my answer seem &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18688971/c-char-array-initialization/18689205#18689205&quot;&gt;patently off-the-mark&lt;/a&gt;. So I'm not proposing that a question, once asked, should be pickled in amber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, there's a difference between an edit that &lt;em&gt;clarifies&lt;/em&gt;, and one that &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt;. In this specific case, both the question and the question title were edited, the former by the OP and the latter by a moderator. The edits drastically changed the purport of the question, and I agree with @Hamlet that those edits were for the worse. The original title was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What to say when there's not a lot to say?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the question elaborated:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;To Autumn&quot; is the 'other' kind of poem in my opinion. It's been described as &quot;nearly perfect, but doesn't have a lot to say&quot;. If I'm not wrong, its only aim is to describe/praise Autumn. How would one effectively comment on Keats' writing in such a context? The poem is bursting with imagery, but how do you comment on it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was the meat of the question as originally asked. It strikes me as being a &lt;em&gt;perfectly valid question&lt;/em&gt;. The OP says s/he could be wrong, but thinks, based on someone's earlier commentary, that &quot;To Autumn&quot; is essentially a pretty but empty poem, and asks how one could write about it. Note that the question is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about pretty but empty poems in general; the question is specifically, &lt;em&gt;How would one effectively comment on &lt;strong&gt;Keats'&lt;/strong&gt; writing in such a context?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, one effectively comments on Keats's writing by showing that the attributed context and the earlier commentary is wrong. That is exactly what I did. Thereafter, @Standback commented to the OP:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That's also why you got an answer that doesn't actually address your question, but only your example - because the question itself isn't very clear. Can you explain what it is you're trying to do, and what you are looking for in an answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OP is being explicitly asked to revise the question because &lt;em&gt;a moderator thinks the provided answer doesn't address it.&lt;/em&gt; However, &lt;strong&gt;on what basis is @Standback saying the answer &quot;doesn't actually address the question&quot;?  That is not for the moderator to decide.&lt;/strong&gt; If the OP thinks it doesn't address it, the OP should be free to ignore the answer, downvote it, or clarify the question. But the moderator, who after all has the power to close the question if it seems off-topic or unclear, should not decide for the asker whether a provided answer is adequate.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the OP &quot;clarified&quot; that what s/he was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; after was some help in writing a commentary on &quot;To Autumn&quot; for his/her homework. Two points here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The edit does have the merit of making clear to everybody's satisfaction what was, to my reading, perfectly clear from the statement of the original question: &lt;em&gt;How would one effectively comment on &lt;strong&gt;Keats'&lt;/strong&gt; writing in such a context?&lt;/em&gt; The edit underlines the fact that the question was never intended to be a general question about a certain kind of poem, but a specific question about &quot;To Autumn&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, if the request to compile a list of commentary for homework help had been in the original question, I would not have answered it. I'm not in the business of doing someone's homework for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To my mind, this edit makes the question unsuitable for the site. If the OP is &quot;looking for commentary on devices in 'To Autumn'&quot;, then the proper place to look is a library catalog, or Google. A list of bibliographic references constitutes basic research, and my understanding is that users are expected to do basic research toward their question before asking it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on this edit, @Rand al'Thor changed the question title to reflect the new ask. (He—I assume &quot;Randal&quot; is a he, apologies if misgendering—also deleted the &lt;code&gt;literary-analysis&lt;/code&gt; tag, for reasons that remain unclear to me.) As @Hamlet says, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The only people who would want a list of &quot;literary devices&quot; used in a specific poem are people who just don't understand literature that well. That edit should not have been made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I take this to mean the edit to both the title (from the moderator) and the question text (from the OP). By this point, the title and intent of the question had changed so much, the answer I had given basically had nothing to do with them. I would have answered neither any question with that title, nor any question with that intent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I'm going over this ground (readily accessible from the history of edits) is that &lt;strong&gt;I think we need a lighter touch. All the changes to the question resulted from moderator interventions to what was a perfectly legitimate question to begin with.&lt;/strong&gt; I disagree, obviously, with the sentiment that the question was ambiguous to begin with. The title was poorly-worded, but the original question was well-formulated and specific enough to warrant a well-formulated, specific answer. If a moderator believes a question is unclear or off-topic, the moderator is free to vote to close it. But those who answer a question in depth and detail do so because they found the question clear and on-topic; that should count for something. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: It is not for moderators to say what a question means, or whether a given answer addresses it. That's between the OP and the answerer. I understand that in a closed beta, things are in flux and a close eye needs to be kept on them. Nevertheless, I suggest we use a lighter touch in demanding that questions and answers conform to our ideas of what they should be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="289" LastActivityDate="2017-01-30T01:01:59.743" CommentCount="8" />

I think it makes a useful case study to raise an interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the first questions on the site that I attempted to answer was &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/736/was-neil-gaimans-stardust-influenced-by-c-s-lewis/&quot;&gt;Was Neil Gaiman&amp;#39;s Stardust influenced by C.S. Lewis?&lt;/a&gt; because I knew a fair amount about the genesis of the book and I thought I could show that the questioners thesis was, at the very least, a minor aspect in the creation of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason is that by co-incidence, I'd just finished reading a novel called Lud-in-the-Mist. Habitually upon finished a novel I like to google around to see if there are any interesting literary allusions connected with it. In this case, I found a large number with Stardust. Try it yourself: google for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=stardust%20lud-in-the-mist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Lud-in-the-Mist Stardust&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and see what comes back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried to distill these oft-remarked upon similarities into an answer and show that there was a strong connection between the two books and that, in turn, these strong connections suggested an influence from Lewis was unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another answer did the same, but they got the wrong book. Their suggested influence, a writer called Lucy Clifford, was named by Gaiman in the same article I used as a reference but only in passing. He named (and praised) Lud-in-the-Mist more frequently. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=stardust%20lucy%20clifford&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google &quot;Lucy Clifford Stardust&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that, aside from the original interview, there's almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would hope that demonstrates that what I'm suggesting is a more factually accurate answer than the other. Yet it's sinking. I presume that's because I went out on a limb and made a statement about Lewis belonging within the great tradition of Tolkien, which Gaiman was trying to escape from in writing the novel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's fair that I was probably on shaky ground make that allusion: it's interesting to consider but I presented what was a weak thesis fairly strongly and that's going to get people's backs up. I should probably go and edit it, and will do so once this has run its course on meta: but the damage is already done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: we have a situation where a badly worded but accurate answer has been outvoted by a clear but incorrect one. This worries me, because anyone looking at that question and the highest voted answer alone is going to walk away with the wrong answer. It seems to me this is a big potential danger for this site, or indeed any SE site, where there's no scientifically agreed 'correct' answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hence the question: on what basis should we be &quot;voting&quot; for things, especially on an SE site where there are dubious criteria for what qualifies as the &quot;right&quot; answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2017-01-30T19:09:55.863" Title="How should we be voting on poor quality but accurate answers?"

Rand also referred many, many people to the Area 51 proposal, without which the site would most likely have not launched in the first place. Additionally, he is currently a moderator on Science Fiction and Fantasy, and has shown himself to be an exemplary moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;I accept this nomination.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me and literature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started reading at a very early age and have devoured thousands of books in my life. My only literature qualification is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt;, but if experience counts as a qualification, then I've always been proudly a bookworm. My speciality is fantasy (&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;, and many others), but my resume also includes Shakespeare, Poe, Borges, Dostoevsky, Hardy, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me and moderation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm currently a moderator on Literature's sister site &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Science Fiction &amp;amp; Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, where I recently earned a Sheriff badge for a full year of service. In that time, I've become familiar with pretty much all the tools available to SE moderators. &lt;strong&gt;Impartiality&lt;/strong&gt; has always been my watchword, as I've done my best to navigate through a site containing many different factions with very different ideas about site policy. I try to be &lt;strong&gt;constantly visible&lt;/strong&gt; in case I'm needed, but &lt;strong&gt;not overly heavy-handed&lt;/strong&gt; in mod actions taken. I would aim to adopt a similar approach on Literature, trying to let the community have their say before taking action, at least insofar as this is possible on a small beta site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(To those who fear I might try to turn Literature into a books-only all-genres version of SFF, rest assured that I'm &lt;em&gt;very pleased&lt;/em&gt; about the way this site is moving away from SFF standards. Most of my favourite posts over there are basically literary analysis, which is pretty rare on that site.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also active on several other SE sites, including in moderation duties. I have four gold Marshal badges for helpful flags, a dozen or so silver Reviewer badges for reviewing, and a total network reputation of around 130,000. Rest assured, I'm pretty experienced with Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me and Literature SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;During the Definition stage at Area 51, I was extremely active in promoting the proposal in all of the many chatrooms I'm active in: bugging people to follow the proposal and use up their votes on example questions, so that it could reach the next stage. While I hope the proposal would have succeeded anyway, I definitely had an effect on the speed of its success.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;During the Commitment stage, I was the very first committer, and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qySCd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;referred &lt;strong&gt;28&lt;/strong&gt; other committers&lt;/a&gt; to the Literature proposal - including several, such as DVK and HDE226868, who have become among our most active users here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also in Area 51, I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/q/25228/124276&quot;&gt;How can we draw more attention to Literature?&lt;/a&gt;, and several community promotion ads on existing sites in order to draw attention to the proposal. Apparently I contributed to Literature discussions on Area 51 meta &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/tags/arts/topusers&quot;&gt;even more than I'd realised&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/users?tab=participation&quot;&gt;most active meta user&lt;/a&gt; since day 1. As well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&amp;amp;filter=all&quot;&gt;voting&lt;/a&gt; conscientiously, I've taken part in important discussions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/305/17&quot;&gt;the future of the site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/336/17&quot;&gt;Lit.1's failures&lt;/a&gt;, and various scope and tagging issues. I was the first person to earn the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/badges/68/convention&quot;&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt; badge for meta participation, and I've now &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/help/badges?tab=tags&amp;amp;filter=bronze&quot;&gt;earned&lt;/a&gt; the first bronze tag badge on either main or meta, for &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/discussion&quot; class=&quot;post-tag required-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;discussion&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the main site, I have again been &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/users?tab=participation&quot;&gt;highly active&lt;/a&gt;, a conscientious &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/users?tab=voters&quot;&gt;voter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/users?tab=editors&quot;&gt;editor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as providing several of what I hope are high-quality questions and answers of my own.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I've been very active in the review queues, doing what moderation I can without diamond powers. I also have the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/badges/70/deputy&quot;&gt;Deputy&lt;/a&gt; badge on main and over 50 helpful flags on meta.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm also apparently the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/1037?m=34902003#34902003&quot;&gt;most active&lt;/a&gt; user in Literature chat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary: I have expended every possible jot of effort into helping this site to succeed, and have been doing so throughout its entire life. I will continue to do so regardless of whether or not I become a moderator here, but I would be honoured to have the responsibility of representing the site in a slightly more 'official' capacity.

It's a nomination that I'll reluctantly, but happily accept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community as it stands right now has strong and widely differing opinions about who we are and what we're going to be. A lot of my reluctance in accepting this nomination comes from the fact that the opinions &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; hold are strong as well - but I'm open to ideas, and will do my best to guide the community toward settling and better defining what it can and should be. And, just as on Puzzling, I'm very open to and accepting of the idea that my opinions might easily not be the ones we end up with. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don't truly mind either way. There's a lot I can do as a regular user, too, to help develop and grow the community, and help us settle into a healthy stability. But if you all would like me to moderate, I'll gladly do it to the best of my ability, with joy and an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.390" LastActivityDate="2017-01-30T18:55:57.897" CommentCount="2" />

To me, a first-time or casual visitor will be interested in &lt;code&gt;russian-literature&lt;/code&gt; and use that as a starting point for searching questions and/or answers. It may also aid in Google searchability; I am thinking of a question like &quot;Are there common themes in Russian Literature?&quot;. An expert, such as a Russian Literature professor, may also do the same, as they will be familiar with many different authors in that classification. We want users to be experts in certain tags (e.g. for gold badges) and it's perfectly reasonable to expect someone to be a expert in &lt;code&gt;language-of-origin&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition it may help users who are not native English speakers. While posts on this site do have to be in English, someone who has a different mother tongue may only want to find questions or give answers about their nation's literature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My final thought on the tagging system, is I always ask myself, &quot;What &lt;em&gt;harm&lt;/em&gt; does this tag do?&quot; (I originally came to this thought from discussion about character tags of SFF.SE). To expand a bit on what &quot;harm&quot; means: is this tag being misused in a way that detracts from the quality of question?

Surely, some people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/113/11&quot;&gt;expert in an author&lt;/a&gt;, not particular works, but how many of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/who-are-the-experts-not-us-weve-grown-a-philosophical-bezoar-lets-work-thi&quot;&gt;&quot;experts&quot; do we have here&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, we can use the manual search to write a search string like &lt;code&gt;[stephen-king] is:q &quot;dark tower&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, but that would require a person (a possible new user) to know how to use the search system, and it is not exactly intuitive to everyone (we're not SO here).

Tags have to improve searchability; &quot;following&quot; is, in my opinion, a secondary task.

Note that [fantastic-beasts] will have its own tag due to being a prequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have tags for each individual work, unless conflicting with previous bullet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may also have tags for universes, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/noon-universe&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;noon-universe&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;noon-universe&lt;/a&gt; by [strugatsky-brothers], or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discworld&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;discworld&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;discworld&lt;/a&gt; (pardon my SF&amp;amp;F parlance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags for individual works won't be blurry or arbitrary such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/classics&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;classics&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;classics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/science-fiction&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;science-fiction&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;science-fiction&lt;/a&gt;.

Tags are supposed to act as a &quot;bat-signal&quot; to allow people who have expertise in a topic to easily find questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a book is part of a series, &lt;strong&gt;tag it with the name of the series&lt;/strong&gt; and only optionally with the name of the individual book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're asking about the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; series, for instance, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/harry-potter&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;harry-potter&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;harry-potter&lt;/a&gt; tag makes much more sense than, say, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hp-and-the-philosophers-stone&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hp-and-the-philosophers-stone&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hp-and-the-philosophers-stone&lt;/a&gt; tag. For one thing, the latter would only be applicable to questions which focus on a specific book, which I expect most questions wouldn't. More importantly, nobody is going to be an expert on just a single book in the series; all 7+ books form a unified whole, and any real HP expert is going to know &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a book &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; part of a series, &lt;strong&gt;give it its own tag&lt;/strong&gt; as well as the author tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my other answer linked above, author tags are worth having because many people will be experts on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the works by a particular author. But conversely, if there's nothing to link a collection of works except that they share an author, then there's no particular reason why an expert on one of them should have read all of them. I've read &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; but not &lt;em&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/em&gt;, for example. These works deserve their own tags, for the sake of people who are experts on a particular book but not on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of that author's works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T16:44:26.520" LastActivityDate="2017-01-30T22:21:45.263" CommentCount="1" />

There has been a lot of debate about whether this is a site for literary analysis or factual questions about literature; I think both types of questions can coexist on the site. That said, I do think that literary analysis questions are an opportunity to distinguish this site from other sites on the network. While you can always ask factual questions on the science fiction stack exchange, literary analysis questions seem to be received better and answered better on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My views on moderation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those familiar with the Mythology Stack Exchange Site, you probably know that I advocated for a heavy-handed moderation policy, at least with regards to academic sources. Here on the Literature Stack Exchange site, I've taken a different approach. As a moderator, I would be largely hands-off. I would defer to the community on pretty much everything, including question closures (in large part because we haven't defined our scope yet). The exceptions to this would be spam, conflicts between members, and other incidents requiring my immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I bring to the table:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I used to moderate several online communities, I haven't done so for several years, and I have no recent experience with moderation. Although I have a lot of experience with the Stack Exchange platform, I would probably lean heavily on the other moderators for my first few months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I think makes me stand out from the other moderators is a clear vision for the site, as well as an understanding of what literature is and what literary analysis is. My role in guiding this site to where it was now can't be understated: I created the area51 proposal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22392/how-can-we-make-this-literature-proposal-succeed-when-other-literature-proposals&quot;&gt;galvanized support to get the site to private beta&lt;/a&gt;, and have been an important voice on meta and chat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be a privilege to continue to serve this site and see it to graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-03T08:41:05.823" LastActivityDate="2017-02-03T07:07:42.103" CommentCount="6" />

You can favorite it or follow it or search for it, but it's perfectly likely that there will never be another question about that piece again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For practically any purpose, a simple text search for the title will give you precisely the same information - possibly more easily, because you're searching natural text, the title as-is, rather than needing to find the correct tag in the tag index.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;If You're Following Single-Use Tags, You're Following A &lt;em&gt;LOT&lt;/em&gt; Of Tags&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only exception I see is &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; tags - if you use some subscription method (RSS, email) to easily find questions that interest you.

Lots of different books can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=time+to+kill&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;have the same title&lt;/a&gt;.

The short version is they were previously set up with the presumption sites needed to be high-traffic to be successful, but they recognised over time that small, low-traffic sites could &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be very successful, and so there's no pressure to have that visitor count.

Seems to me we should be aiming for a sort of &quot;comfy cafe&quot; or &quot;friendly local used bookstore&quot; atmosphere. This means lit.se's a casual place with room for serious conversation.

The fact that the order is the way it is does not mean that the order is good or bad, it simply describes what the order is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I, perhaps, may have been able to equally choose a chronological order. Why is a chronological order better or worse than an order by date of publication, if at all?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it because, as an example, that's what our hypothetical author himself or herself recommends? Is it because reading by the order of publication means the story gets all jumbled up and some events are read in the wrong order? Or is it because you simply prefer that order, and it is just how you're used to reading those books?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is thus important to be as objective as we can when describing reading orders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is the order the author prefers objective simply because it is the author who has preferred it? Nope. However, if the author has good reasons for that order, then that order &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be objective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes a reason &quot;good&quot;? And is that an objective measure? As you can see, quite a few questions must be answered in our minds before we begin writing about the reading order we wish to write about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is thus also important to define what level of objectivity we are talking about here. If we are to consider the strictest sense of the word, then potentially lots of possible reading order suggestions are thrown out, because, well, they're not objective. But if we are to consider a less strict sense, then how much &quot;less strict&quot; are we considering here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal suggestion is that answers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reading-order&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reading-order&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reading-order&lt;/a&gt; questions must:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be strictly objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use nothing out-of-canon to give arguments supporting that reading order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe that reading order as better than others &lt;em&gt;if and only if&lt;/em&gt; that description is strictly objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three requirements are not always easy to achieve, and for some types of books, they could potentially be extremely difficult to fulfill successfully, but I think they may help to avoid answers that are based on mostly personal preferences and perhaps other non-objective answers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="220" LastEditorUserId="220" LastEditDate="2017-02-04T19:43:31.600" LastActivityDate="2017-02-04T19:43:31.600" CommentCount="0" />

Let's not make problems where there are none. So let's look first if there is actually a problem. Perceived problems from question and other answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I'm thinking that okay, there are a few pieces of literature that a lot of questions have been asked about, but if we continue like this, because there are so many different books, we are eventually going to have a hell-load of tags. (OQ)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we'll have a lot of tags. That in itself is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not a problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;as long as those tags are sensible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If we continue like this it is going to become a near impossible task to give all the tags tag-wikis and excerpts. (OQ)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;even less of a problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We don't need tag wiki excerpts for every tag and certainly not full tag wikis. It is generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/08/improved-tagging/&quot;&gt;discouraged to write wikis/excerpts&lt;/a&gt; for well established concepts on Stack Exchange. The same way the technical sites don't need to define an &lt;em&gt;email&lt;/em&gt; tag, we don't need to write wiki entries about books or authors. That's already been done—by Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We only need tag wikis to discern different authors/books by the same name or things like that. The tag &lt;em&gt;the-lord-of-the-rings&lt;/em&gt; wouldn't need a tag wiki. It doesn't hurt, but it's not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But with per-book tags, that means we're going to see a huge number of tags with one or two questions in them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the use of such a tag? You can favorite it or follow it or search for it, but it's perfectly likely that there will never be another question about that piece again. (Standback)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we wasted a few rows in the database. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's not a problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; By definition a properly defined taxonomy will always have niche topics with niche tags. Depriving these topics of their fitting tag will make the taxonomy less coherent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's see how many 1-question tags we have, when we have a thousand or two thousand questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;All of this ambiguity is much more of a problem in tags than it is in plain text. Because tags need to make sense on their own, define their scope and boundaries, have a well-defined independent existence -- whereas a title search, perhaps with an author tag, should have little trouble finding what you're looking for. (Standback on title ambiguity, especially for short titles)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, we have a problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; By definition tags have to be unique (duh!). We don't have disambiguation pages like Wikipedia to differentiate. The question is if simply skipping title tags makes that situation better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What we'd win if we skip title tags now&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Less tags. Yep, that's it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We circumvented (not solved!) our one problem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What we'd lose if we skip title tags now&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tagging works with a lot of questions.&lt;/strong&gt; Other answers admit that title tags are useful for important or popular works. I'll throw my standard example into the fray. Andy Weir's &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;. It's a perfect example why that is a horrible way to discern if a tag is worthwhile or not. Unless we have clairvoyants among us, we'll never find out with the first question if a book (and it's corresponding tag) will be popular or not. However useful tagging has to involve all questions that should be tagged. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It cannot be reasonably established after the fact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searchability for short, ambiguous titles.&lt;/strong&gt; While other answers point out that short titles create clashes the solution is hardly skipping those titles. Searching for them without tags is even worse. The mentioned examples like &lt;em&gt;Love&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;It&lt;/em&gt; won't result in any useful results since those words will be in a lot of questions and answers. Thus, we should try to find a reasonable system to tag Stephen King's &lt;em&gt;It&lt;/em&gt; properly, rather than forgoing it completely. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tagging is the only way to find short titles easily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four of our top 16 tags.&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned above, who decides which works are worthy of a tag and which are not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;TL:DR;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's keep the title tags for now.

At least one user has told me that this is the most active private beta they've been in so far. It's really tempting, therefore, to sit back and assume that we've got it all in the bag for another few weeks, because we'll get another surge of activity that will very quickly build us a large permanent userbase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We won't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least, not right away. &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/227007/274942&quot;&gt;There's always a drop-off&lt;/a&gt; after the first day of private beta that continues for quite a long time. Let me add &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/227016/274942&quot;&gt;Gilles' graph&lt;/a&gt; to show you what it (approximately) looks like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LUOS5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LUOS5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, we're still dropping, and while we may have gotten closer to a steady question rate, it's still nothing like it was the first week. That's still good, but it's obviously not as high as it once was. &lt;strong&gt;That's not a bad thing.&lt;/strong&gt; It's natural. However, we need to keep the momentum going. This is why I wanted people to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ask all their questions in quick succession; spread them out so we can try to keep a decent pace and ensure continuing levels of high activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we're going to get a slight boost now that we're going public. We probably already have. But it's not going to help if we don't keep asking, answering, editing, voting, reviewing, commenting, flagging . . . you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I reread the question, and this time something popped out at me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We've built a great community here, avoided the mistakes of the last Literature site, and sparked useful discussions about the scope of our site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ooh. I'm going to disagree, for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, we've built a community (sort of), but it's one that is quickly going to change. People are going to leave now that private beta's done, and others will come in. It's anyone's guess as to whether new folks will be more or less dedicated to the long-term future of the site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we entered private beta, I read through the old chat transcripts in &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1037/the-reading-room&quot;&gt;the Literature chat room&lt;/a&gt;, going back to the start of the first site. Three weeks into Literature 1.0, it did not seem like the site was doing so poorly. Yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/131397/274942&quot;&gt;the key problems that would take it down&lt;/a&gt; were not yet as apparent, but activity seemed okay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; make the same assumption. Humans have the collective arrogance to think that just because we succeeded where others have failed, we won't fail in the same place. That's not true. There are a dozen ways a site can flop within the first year. Please, please, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don't assume that we won't go the same way as the old site. It took them &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6426/literature&quot;&gt;269 days&lt;/a&gt; to go down, and I'm not at all comfortable assuming that we won't, after about 19 or 20 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Useful scope discussions are still going on and, really, should never stop. As I'm writing this addendum, there's a discussion going on in chat about tagging, which I've been observing from afar. That discussion needs to continue, as will all the ones that come after it.

Some very simple user stories could be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I'm interested in the work of Flannery O'Connor.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I'm interested in the Three Investigators series.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I love talking about poetry; I'll follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/poetry&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;poetry&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; feed, and see what grabs my attention there.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I'm an expert in 18th-century religious literature from Portugal.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are never going to be all things to all people, and it would be impossible to maintain tags that slice the site for all conceivable, or even desirable, user stories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Focus On Author/Book Tagging Will Optimize For Low-Hanging Fruit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Author and book-title tags &lt;em&gt;make sense&lt;/em&gt;, because they're an obvious topic for any given question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as the fundamental organization method of the site, I think they're extremely problematic. Because of all the conceivable user stories that are possible, author/book tags &lt;em&gt;primarily&lt;/em&gt; support the stories of &quot;I am interested particularly in Author X&quot;; &quot;I am interested particularly in Book Y&quot;. And they provide &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; support for any other conceivable use-case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this means, to me, is that author-book tags (and particularly tags for individual books, stories, poems) optimize for &lt;strong&gt;low-hanging fruit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is easiest to find? Questions about individual books. Why would you be looking for a question about an individual book? Because you're &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; aware of that book, intrigued by it, want to learn more about it. &lt;strong&gt;If you're not already interested in a &lt;em&gt;very particular piece&lt;/em&gt;, author-book tags will not help you find anything.&lt;/strong&gt; Some trivial user-stories that go entirely unaddressed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An interesting question on a book you'd previously considered uninteresting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An interesting question on a book you enjoyed, but had forgotten about.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A question interesting for its subject matter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A question interesting for its genre.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A question about a work that's easily available online, that you might consider reading just for the purpose of discussion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I'm describing here is a site that's hugely &lt;em&gt;fragmented&lt;/em&gt;. It would have a small number of major clusters, around the low-hanging fruit -- the stand-out books and series that enjoy immense popularity. And -- this is the kicker -- &lt;strong&gt;it discourages practically any other kind of use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Discouraging Niche Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we build the site around an author/title structure, &lt;strong&gt;it will be difficult to use it in any other way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is daunting to write a question knowing &lt;em&gt;you are opening the category&lt;/em&gt;. That implies a lot about the level of response or interest you're likely to get. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;New users can't even create new tags. That's a pretty strong discouragement from coming to the site and posting a new question on a relatively-undiscussed book or story -- a common and crucial use-case if there ever was one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A user who is less interested in popular fiction -- certainly not our primary user profile, but &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the types of user profile we're interested in, if we want a scope that isn't popular fiction &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; -- is going to have a terrible time finding anything that interests him, even if it's only as basic as &quot;show me a hundred questions that aren't likely to be popular fiction.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even browsing for tags of interest is difficult -- the list of tags, naturally, will see popular authors and books rising to the top. If that's not what you're looking for, your search is going to be a discouraging one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so on. Now, &quot;niche topics are niche&quot; is going to be a problem on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Stack Exchange site. But the problem here, as I see it, is that probably a good 95% of written literature is pretty darn niche. That's its nature. &lt;strong&gt;The balance is different here.&lt;/strong&gt; And if we don't figure out a structure that can work with that, then that balance is going to go askew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is already happening.&lt;/strong&gt; Scroll down the main question page, and ask yourself a simple question: How many questions are about books or stories or works &lt;em&gt;that you, personally, have never heard of&lt;/em&gt;? How many concern works that you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; consider to enjoy immense popularity, or are pretty darn close to being universally known?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not criticizing -- there are many excellent reasons for this to be the case, at this early stage, at the tail-end of the private beta. But if this remains the situation over time, I don't think that speaks to good health for the site. It implies that the user base is focusing on a small number of works that are extremely well known -- while niche topics,which is where a lot of Stack Exchange's power is, are poorly represented and are underserved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;This Is Not An Answer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of this whole lengthy scroll is not &quot;author tags are bad&quot; or &quot;book-title tags are bad.&quot; It is that &lt;strong&gt;we don't know yet how we expect, or want, the site to be used.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My objection isn't to title tags. It's to the &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of other, more meaningful kinds of tags -- which, to me, means we really don't have much of a sense yet of what we cover or how to make the site usable. It's the smoothing-over of that lack, by saying that a question about a minor author and a minor story aren't particularly expected to get any attention after its day on the front page. I object to &lt;strong&gt;adopting&lt;/strong&gt; author-title as our default tagging scheme, because I think it will serve us poorly -- but I have very little idea of what a better scheme might be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe we need to devote effort to building user stories.&lt;/strong&gt; That's the information we're missing at the moment -- a good sense of how we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; the site to be used. The beta is a good &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; for that, but if our seed population is different enough from our target audience, then we're naturally going to steer the site off-target.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All I can say right now is the fragmenting the site by author/title, &lt;em&gt;and nothing else&lt;/em&gt;, is a structure that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; find unappealing -- but whether it's the structure that the community wants, whether it's the structure that the community is aiming for, and whether any alternative structures are an option, is more than I know how to answer right now :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T16:44:26.520" LastActivityDate="2017-02-07T13:25:39.673" CommentCount="2" />

I would prefer to take remedial action than see someone who's made a number of useful contributions leave the beta.

I would offer to delete the question and/or answer but it seems the majority of users find it helpful or interesting. I don't know if it's possible for me to drop the gained reputation: maybe I could offer it as a bounty on one of your questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) I posted it because asking and answering my own questions is my usual approach to literary questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I finish a book that I have enjoyed, it's my usual practice to look up criticism on that book and read around it. If I have particular questions about the book, I will focus my research there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I read Moby-Dick as an adult (I am not American, and I hadn't twigged it might be a popular study book in the school system) and was fascinated by its structure. I had not read a novel built like that before (although as other commentators have pointed out, there are earlier examples). I had presumed that Melville was writing some sort of historical record: that he wanted to set down how whales were hunted in the age of sail before heavy engineering changed it forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On reading some critical essays it became clear that I was mistaken. So, my question is an honest one based on an interest in the book's peculiar structure. And my answer is a distillation of three essays on the subject that I read. I have at least one other self-answered question on the site, which came about by the same process. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's my motivation. As this is a beta, repeating the questions I could remember asking myself and summarizing what I'd learned seemed a useful way of seeding the site with content.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) I'm not sure what sort of answers you think it is in the remit of the site to provide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if it's been deleted or not, but at one point you referred to my answer as &quot;sparknotes&quot;. I found this a curious criticism because, IMO, that's exactly what the site ought to be aiming at in terms of answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider. The subject of literature will inevitably attract imprecise questions (something that has not proved problematic on SE sites such as Worldbuilding). These sorts of open questions are probably best answered by exploring the subject at length. But this is a Q&amp;amp;A format in which long essays will make for very poor answers. Therefore it would seem reasonable to expect a good answer to this type of question to be a concise summary of common critical thinking around a subject. And that is exactly what revision notes ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you feel that my answer is too much waffle with insufficient supporting quotes or evidence. I had a quick look at the answers to your questions which you've accepted and it seemed - please excuse me if I'm incorrect - that that was the chief differentiation between those answers and mine. If so, I have a great deal of sympathy with this viewpoint: we should be supporting answers with examples wherever possible. But in the case of Moby-Dick Melville did not leave extensive notes on the composition. And since he is long dead, supposition is the best that we can do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastActivityDate="2017-02-09T09:22:56.600" CommentCount="3" />

Debating whether a book is this or that genre is sterile. Many books have elements of one genre, and other elements of another genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Subgenre identification is even worse. For example, I've never seen anything good come out of a debate about science fiction vs. fantasy. I mean, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is clearly fantasy — it's a fairy tale — while &lt;em&gt;Discworld&lt;/em&gt; is clearly hard science fiction (it has well-defined physics), but for some reason those works are marketed in different categories, so presumably there are valid arguments in the opposite direction.

Writers need to market their books, and marketing a book works differently in different genres. Marketing a book in a particular genre also sets readers' expectation.

It's only the request to put a book in a particular box that should be rejected. There are types of questions related to genre classification that are relevant and productive, such as “how are common elements (tropes) of this genre expressed in this work?” (e.g. discussions of Chekhov's gun in a mystery — or rather, a book with mystery elements) or “what influence did this book have on this genre?”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="57" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:43:39.817" LastActivityDate="2017-02-11T19:02:36.630" CommentCount="1" />

Perhaps we'll end up discouraging all broad tags &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; those based on the original language of the work.

Many people have specialised genre-wise, and might be very knowledgeable about one genre and not so much about any other. Having a tag for, say, science fiction would enable science fiction experts to find questions that interest them without having to hunt through dozens or hundreds of different author/work tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we can't have too many different types of broad tag. Each question can only have at most five tags, and at least two of these are already being taken by the author and work/series tags. If we add tags for language and genre, we're already almost at the limit.

Whereas &quot;What characters in &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; are based upon real people&quot; seems like a &lt;em&gt;narrow&lt;/em&gt; list, and one based on a very significant common element -- no different from, say, &quot;What mathematical paradoxes are discussed in &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, I believe we need to be wary of &lt;strong&gt;arbitrary questions&lt;/strong&gt; - questions that &lt;em&gt;arbitrarily assume&lt;/em&gt; that a certain significance, inspiration, meaning, might possibly exist in a piece, and &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; that the community prove or disprove this conjecture. It's kind of fishing for a question -- &quot;I don't &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; if there's anything interesting here, but I'll &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt;, in case it turns out there is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions like this are extremely easy to ask, are often unanswerable, and produce site content that feels like a list of undercooked stabs in the literary dark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad questions, e.g. requesting inspiration sources for a large number of characters &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; clear focus and justification, are very likely to be arbitrary fishing questions.&lt;/strong&gt; I would not want to see future blanket questions justified by &quot;But on Meta we said it's OK to ask about a large number of characters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some questions quite rightly cast a wide net. Sometimes you're asking about something the repeats broadly, that has many instances, and the entire point is to ask about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them. This will usually be something &lt;em&gt;very specific&lt;/em&gt;, and that's why asking &quot;Tell me &lt;em&gt;about this specific thing&lt;/em&gt; across a broad range&quot; can make a lot of sense, and be well scoped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I would say the guideline for whether a question on character inspirations would be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The OP should explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is reasonable to expect to find the kind of character inspiration s/he's looking for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The OP should be asking for something that makes sense as a single, cohesive answer, rather than a &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of unrelated answers, each pertaining to a different character.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a question satisfies those, then it doesn't matter how many characters the question covers.

The first is to use the literary-criticism tag to be about applying literary theory when conducting literary analysis. The second is to treat literary criticism as a synonym of literary analysis, and get rid of it.

Wikipedia uses the following definition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no extranoematic responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, these are usually works where the full work is more than just the contents of a linear piece of text. They might be nonlinear or the typesetting might be part of the story being told, etc. Popular works include The Unfortunates (B. S. Johnson), House of Leaves (Mark Z. Danielewski) and S. (Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams). As this is a very specific kind of literature, I'm sure there might a) people interested specifically in these works (I know I am) and b) people with specific expertise in analysing them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that there &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/457/298&quot;&gt;seems to be a consensus&lt;/a&gt; against introducing genre-specific tags, but I'm not sure ergodic literature is really a &quot;genre&quot;. It seems to be a classification that is orthogonal to genres. There is no reason why there couldn't be ergodic crime stories, fantasy novels or historical fiction. Furthermore, the distinction whether any given work is ergodic or not is a lot less subjective than genre boundaries (which is the main reason for disallowing genre-based tags).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm aware of four questions where the tag might be applicable:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/836/298&quot;&gt;What is the meaning of the blue X in the Three Attic Whalestoe Letters in House of Leaves?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/994/298&quot;&gt;Why is the poem &amp;quot;Yggdrasil&amp;quot; placed where it is in House of Leaves, and which narrator included it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/346/298&quot;&gt;What techniques were used in &amp;quot;The Unfortunates&amp;quot; in order to allow the story to be read in random order?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/73/298&quot;&gt;Was Nabokov&amp;#39;s Pale Fire intended to be read non-linearly, i.e. jumping to each line reference?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would likely also apply to questions about choose-your-own-adventure-style books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2017-02-21T22:06:27.447" Title="Could we use an [ergodic-literature] tag?"

Here are some of the reasons why I think my more specific proposal won't be so controversial:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shorter works are less likely to be areas of specialist interest.&lt;/strong&gt; It's possible to be an expert in the &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; series, or in &lt;em&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/em&gt; - even without having read other books by the same author - but it's much less likely anyone is going to be an expert in a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; Byron poem or a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; Asimov short story, without having experience of a wider collection of them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shorter works are more numerous with fewer questions each.&lt;/strong&gt; A long novel or play will have more complexity and be more likely to inspire questions than a short story or poem, and a single author is unlikely to have too many lengthy works to their name. But it's easy for one person to churn out hundreds of poems and short stories, and hundreds of low-use tags isn't ideal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This proposal would resolve the redundancy issue.&lt;/strong&gt; Using tags for both individual short works and for poems/short stories as a whole, as currently, leads to tagging redundancies, and with only 5 slots we need all the room we can get for tags. Keeping the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/poetry&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;poetry&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/short-stories&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;short-stories&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;short-stories&lt;/a&gt; tags (per previous consensus) and getting rid of individual-work tags of this type eliminates this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/poetry&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;poetry&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/short-stories&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;short-stories&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;short-stories&lt;/a&gt; tags instead of individual-work tags will mean these two are likely to be among our top few tags. But hey, that's &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/tags&quot;&gt;already the case&lt;/a&gt;. And that's fine: broad but still useful tags such as these give a good impression of a site covering a wide range of topics, better than the top of the list being just whichever author/work tags happen to get the most questions.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR: here's my suggested tagging guidance.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For questions about &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; works - whether novels, series, or lengthy poems like the Iliad or Mahabharata - &lt;strong&gt;use author and work tags&lt;/strong&gt;, as we've already been doing. These works are likely to inspire more questions, and to be searched for as a specific area of interest. (Collections of short works, e.g. William Blake's &lt;em&gt;Songs of Innocence and Experience&lt;/em&gt;, may also count here.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For questions about &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; works, &lt;strong&gt;use the author tag with &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/poetry&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;poetry&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/short-stories&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;short-stories&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;short-stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. New users will be able to tag their questions appropriately even if there've been no previous questions about precisely the same work, and we won't be overrun by thousands of overly specific tags. (Tags for specific, perhaps especially noteworthy, short works are optional but not encouraged.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The line between short and long works isn't fully defined, but it's still a line worth drawing, and clear enough to base a policy on. We can use common sense for anything in the grey area (I'd err on the side of creating tags if there's any dispute, since more tags in the system don't really harm anyone).&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2017-05-17T17:54:47.710" Title="A proposal for [poetry] and [short-stories]" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;tags&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="24" FavoriteCount="1" />

It's usually &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt; to leave explanations of downvotes and especially close-votes: constructive criticism is more likely to lead to improvement of the post than silent votes are. But on the other hand, people should be able to upvote or downvote as they wish without advertising the fact and potentially subjecting themselves to angry comments or retaliatory votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close votes&lt;/strong&gt; should always be explained, and in fact the system &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; every close-voter to choose a reason: &quot;primarily opinion-based&quot;, &quot;too broad&quot;, etc. That reason is often pretty broad and it may not be clear exactly how it applies to the specific question (so leaving a comment as well is &lt;em&gt;encouraged&lt;/em&gt;), but it's better than nothing. In addition, if a question is successfully closed, then the list of close-voters is public, so they can then be asked individually to explain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downvotes&lt;/strong&gt; should usually be explained, but it's not mandatory. Upvotes and downvotes are anonymous by design - they're supposed to be a way of maintaining quality, by recording an aggregate of users' subjective opinions of a post. As mentioned above, constructive criticism is helpful, but nobody should refrain from downvoting just because they're scared to advertise themselves as doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upvotes&lt;/strong&gt; don't really need explanation at all. If you think a post is good, upvote it and leave it at that. There's no real need to tell the OP why you thought it was good, since they (presumably) already think it's good! If a post has already been heavily downvoted, you might consider leaving an explanation for your upvote, in the hope of convincing others that this is in fact an overlooked gem - but in general, there's no point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2017-02-16T01:47:47.837" CommentCount="1" />

It's fine to explain your votes if you want to, but we shouldn't have a policy stating that it's necessary. I'd hesitate even to encourage it, because that could look like an unofficial requirement to comment, defeating the anonymity of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My point here is that if someone downvotes a post and leaves no comment, then the voter has done nothing wrong. Comments accompanying votes are fine and can be helpful, but we should not set up a culture here that makes people feel like they have to choose between commenting on their votes or refraining from voting. Anonymous votes, including anonymous downvotes, are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Upvotes&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving an explanation of your vote is a nice gesture, but it's not always necessary.

The &lt;code&gt;[enter image description here]&lt;/code&gt; part serves two purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most important, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/144080/whats-the-point-in-adding-alt-text-to-an-image/144082#144082&quot;&gt;adds an attribute&lt;/a&gt; to the picture so that when the picture cannot be loaded, or when using a vision-impaired user software, the description will provide some information about what's going on on it (hat tip to @BESW for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/35473387#35473387&quot;&gt;pointing this out&lt;/a&gt;). Because of this, you the prospective editors are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;add meaningful descriptions&lt;/strong&gt; for any pictures that are essential for your post. Nonessential, or purely &lt;strong&gt;decorative pictures should have their description field empty&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The description eases the indexing of your images, so that when you have to edit replace one, it will be easier to locate it among the links at the bottom of your answer. Note that you can customise not only the description, but also the link, e.g. if you have &lt;code&gt;[![description][foo]][bar]&lt;/code&gt; you can do two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name your image in you references, so that your link looks like &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;code&gt;[foo]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/blabla.jpg &quot;some comment&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add one thing as image, but clicking on it will lead you to different place&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (i. e. not Imgur). In this case, your in-text link looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![description][foo]][bar]&lt;/code&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and your end-text links look like&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[foo]: https://imgur stuff/picture.jpg &quot;some comment&quot;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[bar]: https://pottermore.com/stuff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hover text&lt;/strong&gt;. This part is what ordinary readers will be interested in. Note that this &lt;a href=&quot;https://silktide.com/i-thought-title-text-improved-accessibility-i-was-wrong/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doesn't benefit&lt;/strong&gt; the visually-impaired users&lt;/a&gt; (hat tip to @doppelgreener), so if the picture is self-explanatory, it is better to leave this field empty. In fact, the hovertext is a function that is better used sparingly - if you want to clarify something about the image, the place to do this is the question body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hovertext is edited in the end-text links by putting a comment in quotes directly after the link, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[foo]: https://i.stackimgur.com/pic.jpg &quot;your comment&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which will look like this (hover your cursor over it!):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dnKI.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1qOtk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Saitama in his natural state&quot; title=&quot;Saitama picking his nose&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transript&lt;/strong&gt;. In my understanding, this is the most important part, given the specific need @Stokhet has pointed out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After posting a pretty picture with fancy hover text, it comes down to explaining what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; is going on the picture. Putting this in the hovertext is absurd, as sometimes a transcript may be a couple of paragraphs (damn you, Alan Moore!). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one thing I am not sure about is the content of the transcript. Two alternatives I see are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full transcript&lt;/strong&gt;. This would require one to transcribe &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; on particular slide, meaning all the speech bubbles, description bubbles, and even the graphical content. This is a lot of work, but I think this option is what we should be aiming for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short, synopsis-like description&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, you outline, in general terms, what is going on on the picture. This requires a bit less work (but more creativity), and could be not as informative as the previous option. Note that this option is pointless if there are important quotes on the picture.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, it would be nice to put a transcript in a quote, directly after the picture. In fact, I think it is even acceptable to put the transcript in HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; marks, which will make it half the size of normal text:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt; This text will be small! &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; Like this! &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: Needless to say, abuse of this feature, including intentional misdirection of unsuspecting users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5133/70236&quot;&gt;TVTropes&lt;/a&gt;, is punishable by death. &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; This answer uses the information from &lt;a href=&quot;https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3430&quot;&gt;this answer over at Mi Yodeya&lt;/a&gt;, and the editing help page, especially the parts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/editing-help#images&quot;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/editing-help#links&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2017-02-16T14:51:56.430" CommentCount="0" />

On their meta we find &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/995/are-interpretations-of-song-lyrics-poems-or-other-creative-works-on-topic/997#997&quot;&gt;the following&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If the question is about the grammaticality of line of poetry or what the metaphor is supposed to be, then that's OK. If it is about the cultural relevance of the item than that's off-topic. &lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/a/997/148459&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with that sentiment. While here on Literature we may not deal with grammar we certainly deal with metaphors and meanings. In addition, &quot;General Reference&quot; is no longer a close reason, so this would allow what might be considered &quot;trivia questions&quot; to be on topic as well. However, this should not prevent poorly researched questions from being down-voted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, on Music Fans song lyrics are on-topic from what I can gather. They are also a newer site (older than Literature, but still in Beta) and still growing and learning as Literature is. On their meta we see &lt;a href=&quot;https://musicfans.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/63/what-should-answers-look-like-to-questions-about-the-meaning-of-lyrics&quot;&gt;the following discussion on lyrics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;First I think we have to realize that the meaning of lyrics may have multiple interpretations especially to different people. We should seek answers that are either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Interpretations from the person who wrote the lyrics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Commonly accepted interpretations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first should be preferred over the second, but lyricists sometimes don't explain their lyrics at all. In either case though a source should be required to keep the answers from just being personal interpretations which there could be infinite. &lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://musicfans.meta.stackexchange.com/a/64&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also agree with this answer as we should try to find if the original author has commented on the issue and then those answers should be given more weight that others. Since Stack Exchange is a site for &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/who-are-the-experts-not-us-weve-grown-a-philosophical-bezoar-lets-work-thi?noredirect=1&amp;amp;lq=1&quot;&gt;&quot;experts&quot;&lt;/a&gt; we should tailor our answers in that format. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say other forms of literary analysis are wrong, of course they have their place on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I feel that the site will self regulate and that good questions and good answers will always rise to the top.

If the question were about his place in American literature, that would make it on-topic:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How have Bob Dylan's lyrics affected and been affected by contemporary American poetry?

The citation from the Nobel Academy lays out the reasons he was considered award-worthy, and arguing whether or not those reasons are valid is pointless; the award is a done deal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there any rare literature work that is available in selected libraries only?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would probably wager that this would get a lot of downvotes and perhaps even close votes as unclear what you're asking:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many libraries have rare book rooms with manuscripts from authors that contain unpublished works. For example, F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story &quot;Temperature&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anne-margaret-daniel/f-scott-fitzgeralds-short_b_7940224.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;languished&lt;/a&gt; at Princeton for decades; a similar fate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/discovered-a-lost-short-story-from-edith-wharton/415215/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;befell&lt;/a&gt; Edith Wharton's &quot;Field of Honor&quot; at Yale. Of course those are rare literature works unavailable elsewhere until they are discovered and published.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rare book rooms are also repositories of medieval books, transcribed and illuminated by hand. Each copy is unique as books weren't mass-produced but bore the imprint of the scribe who made the copy. Every medieval manuscript, even if it is a manuscript of a work since printed and widely available, is a rare work of literature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even mass-produced books go out of print, thereby becoming hard to find except in research libraries. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some books even get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/26/specials/leavitt-owns.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;recalled by publishers&lt;/a&gt; a few months after publication, meaning that a library is probably the only place they can be seen. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what do you mean by &quot;rare&quot; works and &quot;selected&quot; libraries?

On those sites it's pretty common to downvote and close such questions, which I don't agree with, so we're already one step ahead: whether we edit or explain in answers, we're still teaching the questioner something they hadn't known before. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I favor explaining in answers is that an answer is a much better venue for teaching the questioner something than an edit is. verbose's explanation in the linked answer is brilliant, and it engages with the questioner at their current level of understanding, whereas the best we could do in an edit is change the language to match the question as it would be written by someone who already understands this distinction. This could well leave the questioner looking at the edited version and wondering what exactly was wrong with what they originally wrote. Instead of directly teaching them something, it forces them into a game of &quot;Spot ten differences between this edited post and your original post&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if we get lots of questions like this, it'll get tedious explaining this all the time. And we will probably get lots of questions like this; I've already seen plenty of posts on Meta talking about how the author's word and intent should be the gold standard for evidence in answers, which just isn't how most literary analysis works. So the best solution might be to write a canonical question, something like &quot;What is the intentional fallacy?&quot;, that explains the distinction. If we see a question that commits this fallacy, we can mention that the question isn't specific enough to answer as is and point them at this canonical question as a guide for making edits. If it becomes a big enough problem we can start closing as &quot;unclear what you're asking&quot; until the edits are made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The benefit I see for having a canonical question is that we avoid repeating the same explanation in dozens or hundreds of answers, but we still have the flexibility that an answer offers for teaching a concept instead of having to monkey-see monkey-do it with edits. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the best case, the questioner understands what needs to be done to fix their question and does it on their own without further interference. But if a questioner still doesn't understand what needs to be done, or doesn't feel capable of doing it, then we can still make edits ourselves to bring the question on-topic, while also addressing the questioner's specific confusions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In effect, this process can serve as a sort of workshop on the intentional fallacy for those questioners who are willing to learn: they get a general explanation of the concept from the canonical question, but they can also get help on their specific case from comments or edits made by helpful community members. This way, even if someone other than the questioner has to make the edits, the questioner at least has a reference point for the purpose of the edits was. This might also be a useful model to adopt for other issues where questioners' instincts are at odds with accepted practice in literary criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastEditorUserId="115" LastEditDate="2017-02-21T04:48:17.053" LastActivityDate="2017-02-21T04:48:17.053" CommentCount="4" />

Well...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editing the question to address a framing issue, and then answering the question without the framing issue, while potentially valuable, means that those who find the question later &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; find something that directly challenges their framing problem.

But readers are liable to have that framing problem that gets carried through many questions, and that's just a systemic problem in the field of literature that we're going to have to deal with as a site. Editing that out of the questions restricts our ability to ask and answer questions with the ability to reach more people and further the spread of thought and information about literature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result, &lt;strong&gt;an answer that addresses &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the intentional fallacy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; provides a good answer with an implicitly-edited removal of it would be the ideal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastActivityDate="2017-02-21T04:01:18.733" CommentCount="1" />

For example, if the question were asking for a reading order of Shakespeare's plays, an answer might provide an overview of which plays are typically covered in an Intro to Shakespeare course, based on a sampling of college syllabi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastActivityDate="2017-02-22T05:22:57.477" CommentCount="3" />

As long as a well-defined criteria for the guide is given, I think this falls within the bounds I've described here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There might be other well-defined orderings that could be asked about; this can't be an exhaustive list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I would like to see reading-order questions nudged towards asking for a &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; order - publishing, chronological, etc, rather than just asking &quot;What order should I read this in?&quot;. I think it would be much clearer to have one question for publication order and a separate one for chronological order, than to have those be two different, contrasting answers to the same question, with vote-counts implying that one of these is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more correct&quot; than the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is one part of a larger observation: &lt;strong&gt;requesting subjective suggestions for reading order, is exactly the same as asking for a reading recommendation.&lt;/strong&gt; It may be a limited, well-scoped, well-defined reading recommendation, but it still boils down to &quot;what do you recommend that I read,&quot; which we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2/should-recommendation-questions-be-on-topic&quot;&gt;firmly come down against&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the case whether the question is &quot;What volumes of this series are essential and which can I skip&quot;; or &quot;What ordering of this author's works will best make me appreciate his themes and ideas&quot;; or &quot;I know the publication and chronology orders, but maybe &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; reading order that makes reading the series &lt;em&gt;really fantastic&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; These are all great things to discuss, but they are very poor Stack Exchange questions, and will have all the problems we're trying to avoid with reading recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effectively, my position is that &lt;strong&gt;requesting lists, orderings, subgroups of books is fine; requesting &lt;em&gt;recommendations&lt;/em&gt; for reading order is just another recommendation quetion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T16:44:26.520" LastActivityDate="2017-02-22T11:44:42.237" CommentCount="7" />

This is the order hundreds, thousands or millions of people (had to) read the texts when they were first released and in most cases this is also the order the author initially wanted people to experience them in. Publication order is usually easily determined by a quick glance at Wikipedia or some other source and doesn't require an &quot;expert&quot; answer on Stack Exchange (exception could be older works where the publication order might not be well documented).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that when people ask for a reading order of a set of books, they must have some reason to assume that there must be other factors which make deviating from publication order a good idea. Common reasons include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Publication order does not correspond to the chronological order of the plot. This is commonly the case when prequels are written later or when gaps in the story are filled in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Texts may be published in a different order than they were written. It's reasonable to assume (&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/141/298&quot;&gt;but not necessarily the case&lt;/a&gt;), that following this more &quot;natural&quot; order will lead to better reading experience.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This usually but not always goes hand in hand with the first point, but multiple texts surrounding the same story often spoil or foreshadow each others' plot twists. By changing the reading order, one might be able to enhance the suspense and satisfaction of plot twists. A popular example of this from the world of movies is &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/11964/31127&quot;&gt;Machete order&lt;/a&gt; for watching Star Wars.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes multiple tangentially related stories are being told throughout several books. Do you read one story first and then the other? Do you interleave them in publication other? Do the stories intersect at important points in the plots due to which the books should ideally be interleaved in a different order?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that in all of these cases, we can craft better questions and answers if we just &lt;strong&gt;ask directly about the thing that makes us think that publication order might not be the best&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&quot;What is the best order to read X in?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; is a fairly vague, broad and potentially very subjective question. However, all of the following are answerable questions, that help &lt;em&gt;the asker make an informed decision about the reading order themselves&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the chronological order of the books in the X series?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What order were X's novels written in?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can the books set in the X universe be split into separate subseries and how do those interrelate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such questions would result in useful content that people can use to find a recording according to their own preferences. Note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/JmnAP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/339aO.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZpSf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; existing reading order questions don't necessarily present a reading order. But they give the asker all the relevant information to pick out their own order without the risk of spoilers and with the chance to enhance their reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to make clear that I'm not advocating a blanket ban on reading order questions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/131/298&quot;&gt;Harper Lee question&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a very useful and evidently answerable question about an optimal reading order. But what makes it a good question is that &lt;em&gt;it focuses on the reason why one might deviate from publication order&lt;/em&gt;. If you don't provide that reason in the question, you might just end up with an answer that is essentially &quot;publication order, duh&quot;, but if you do that gives answerers a basis for telling you &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; one or the other might be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that came up in chat is asking questions &lt;em&gt;about a specific reading order&lt;/em&gt;. Again, I think these can be good questions, if they want to discuss the merits of a certain order in way that falls into the scope of literary analysis. Going back to the example of Machete order (although it's not a literary example, it helps to illustrate the point), I could imagine the following question being answered in a way that is no more subjective than any other literary analysis:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does Machete order improve the plot of Star Wars by reordering the major plot twists of the story?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we make reading-order questions about the reasons to deviate from publication order, and try to focus on the underlying information that would make someone choose and a different, then this will automatically eliminate reading-order questions about works where reading order is arbitrary (because all works are completely independent) or should necessarily be publication order (because each work builds on the previous one).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2017-02-22T13:59:47.973" CommentCount="4" />

These days there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/04/putting-the-community-back-in-wiki/&quot;&gt;three basic reasons&lt;/a&gt; to use CW:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Compiling a canonical reference&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consolidating the knowledge of the community&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Encouraging the ongoing, active maintenance of a changing answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Community wiki is for a special scenario, something built not by the expertise of one individual, then improved or iterated on by a few others, but rather something created by the concerted efforts of the community as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/04/putting-the-community-back-in-wiki/&quot;&gt;&quot;Putting the Community back in Wiki&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see this particular answer needing CW to make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/11741/244929&quot;&gt;&quot;easier to edit and maintain by a wider group of users,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; so I don't see any reason for it to be a community wiki.

They have the choice to make their answer CW, which affects &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; their answer; overriding that under normal circumstances would be akin to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/in-defense-of-editing/&quot;&gt;forcing them to accept an edit&lt;/a&gt; - putting their name and image on words they explicitly rejected. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bit of background: Community Wiki has a long and troubled history on these sites, &lt;em&gt;primarily&lt;/em&gt; because of its use in the now long-distant past on questions as a means of allowing otherwise-unsuitable discussions, polls and the like. For a very long time, the system actually &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; CW onto posts that attracted either a large number of answers or a large number of edits... But &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/04/putting-the-community-back-in-wiki/&quot;&gt;we put that behavior to rest nearly 3 years ago now&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the use of CW at the discretion of answer authors in the common case, and moderators for extremely &lt;em&gt;uncommon&lt;/em&gt; cases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An author can still apply the status manually when posting or when editing their own answer, and moderators retain the ability to apply it when they deem it truly necessary (for instance, a question attracting very large numbers of partial answers can be a sign of a topic that wants to be a wiki). For the most part, we’ve turned it back into something that &lt;em&gt;you can choose to use in cases where it lets you work together to create something wonderful:&lt;/em&gt; [...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Much longer background: chimerical moral rights&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These sites are a delicate balance between multiple systems and philosophies. The original documentation explained them with this diagram:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAUXd.png&quot; alt=&quot;a potent cocktail of wiki, blog, forum and... link-sharing thingy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this results in a fair bit of conflict between how folks &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; things to work and how they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; work - on all sides of the equation. A member used to a traditional online forum might expect to post questions or replies and never update them; a blogger might expect to update their own posts but never see another editor messing with them; a wikian might expect to readily edit &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieving a harmonious balance of expectations here is critical to the long-term viability of a community.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the goal of a site is to serve as a repository of information for future readers, a sense of community ownership is needed - we cannot forever hold an individual author responsible for updating or even disseminating information. At the same time, individual ownership provides a great deal of motivation: both the reputation score and the simple ability to point to a profile filled with useful, informative posts are extremely satisfying to many who participate here. So we cannot entirely overlook one in favor of another without either alienating other members of the site or hurting its usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in the place where this system sits - in between extremes - there lives an often-overlooked set of concerns, something often referred to in legal areas as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;moral rights&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. As is often the case with concepts that've been codified in law, finding a clear, succinct explanation for these can be difficult; I like this one, which I found on the website of the Australian law firm Epiphany Law in the article, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://epiphany.law/articles/copyright/what-are-moral-rights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;What Are Moral Rights?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the moral rights recognise the connection between a creator and his or her work. They are concerned with whether the creator has been properly linked with the work and whether the work has been treated with dignity (or at least not in a derogatory way).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider for a moment what these sites do with the material that we all write on them: they combine it with the work of others, allow others to modify it, and allow others to take and build upon it. Your beautiful question may be sullied at any time by an answer you find offensive, or advertised on another site dedicated to a topic you find reprehensible; your carefully-crafted answer may be shown next to a sloppy and incorrect one, quoted by someone who misinterprets it. They're still &quot;your&quot; posts, but you've ceded control over how they are used, and this opens you up to situations in which you may find yourself very unhappy with the uses they are put to. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a dilemma that we've struggled with for the entire 9+ year history of the network, and the often-subtle underpinning of a great many odd features and unusual rules. To name a few:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By default, authors can delete their posts for any reason&lt;/strong&gt;...

If a subsequent editor achieves a large majority of authorship, their name will be displayed; if no large majority can be attributed to a single author, no name is displayed by default; rather, a link to the revision history containing each author's contribution is displayed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;...never display an author's profile image or other profile statistics on the question page.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; of this feature is clearly to bump a given post a little bit further away from the &quot;forum&quot; side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAUXd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;that euler diagram&lt;/a&gt; and a little bit closer to the &quot;wiki&quot; side. But what that actually &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; goes much further than just making it a bit easier for others to edit: there's a very clear de-emphasis of author-ownership, both in how the post is displayed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in how the system treats it. This is made explicit when an author elects to make a post CW:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0eglD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few things to note there:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You're giving up &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; ownership. Behind the scenes, your account still &quot;owns&quot; the post (it appears in your profile, you get more weight when approving or rejecting &lt;em&gt;suggested&lt;/em&gt; edits, you get notified of comments, you can still delete it). But you don't get ultimate credit for it, either in terms of how it is displayed on the page, or in terms of how the system rewards you for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can't &quot;take it back&quot;. Once you've handed over ownership to the community, it's theirs - the status sticks to the post no matter how many subsequent edits you make... Or how few subsequent edits anyone else makes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Wiki got a bum rap for years, mostly because it was &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; onto posts by the system or other users. We had good intentions there, but... &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/04/putting-the-community-back-in-wiki/&quot;&gt;It was a bad idea and we no longer do that&lt;/a&gt;. What &lt;em&gt;remains&lt;/em&gt; is actually pretty cool, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you look at it from the perspective of what it enables: &lt;strong&gt;authors can symbolically give up ownership of a post at any time.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this clearly isn't a &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; action; that pop-up dialog is less than a page long. You retain the copyright to anything you write here. But it does align itself with some of those moral rights we discussed earlier: you get to say - in a public way, totally under your control - that you no longer want sole credit for a given post. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all of the controversy that has plagued CW over the years, that particular usage has remained remarkably consistent: as far back as I can remember, folks have reached for CW when they didn't feel like taking credit for an answer. Now, sometimes this has seemed a little bit dirty, even manipulative: marking a post CW to avoid getting dinged by downvotes, or to keep your reputation at an even 10K for example. But it's also been used to acknowledge the contributions of others to a FAQ or omnibus answer - even if no one else ever edits, by de-emphasizing the author more focus is put on the words - and attributions - in the post itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And on the topic of...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Abuse&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most often-cited criticisms of authors using Community Wiki on answers is that they might do so to shield themselves from the penalty imposed by downvotes. This is almost never valid; in nearly any situation where it would matter, the author is allowed to &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; the post at any time, which also immediately refunds any reputation lost to downvotes. In fact, CW makes downvotes on answers &lt;em&gt;free to the voter as well&lt;/em&gt;, which can mean a bad answer is more readily downvoted. Moderators and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/trusted-user&quot;&gt;trusted users&lt;/a&gt; are not hindered from deleting CW answers, so nothing in the status hinders moderation and may in fact encourage it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more subtle concern I think is...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Peer pressure breaking windows&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A long, long time ago, when Stack Overflow was young and the rocks were still all red and soft, a few of us got it into our heads that it'd be a great idea to pressure other people into making their posts CW in cases where they were clearly &lt;em&gt;undeserving&lt;/em&gt; of reputation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...we didn't have very good luck with this and eventually gave up. But, the fact remains, we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; try. And maybe others would try again, somewhere else where the proverbial rocks are still soft and runny. So, the specter looms whenever CW is brought up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sympathize with this. But, ultimately it is harassment that is the problem here, not CW. If, for example, it becomes commonplace for authors to use CW on posts that are mostly quotes, then what harm is there in that if they do so by choice? Either the answers are problematic in the same way that they would be &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; CW, or they are not problematic; only if the authors are harassed when they &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; use CW is there a problem, just as there is a problem when authors are harassed &lt;em&gt;for any other reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an author chooses to use Community Wiki, that's their business - &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0eglD.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the system has informed them of the consequences&lt;/a&gt; and they've made their decision. If you encounter one of those rare situations that &lt;em&gt;demands&lt;/em&gt; a wiki answer, especially one where &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a wiki answer is appropriate for a given question... Then raise a discussion and get the moderators involved. If you observe harassment, flag it. If you see a bad answer, downvote it; a good one, upvote it. And if you don't see a problem... Don't make one.

Good questions should be able to be answered in a way that can be factually justified (rather than just soliciting opinions). They should also be useful for future readers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/55943/accurate-surveys-of-urban-pigeon-and-bird-populations&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; on Biology SE is an acceptable resource request because it can be answered in a factual way and is potentially useful for future readers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bad&quot; resource requests tend to attract opinionated answers and spam, and answers can't necessarily be justified in a factual way.

For example, I think of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/304/225&quot;&gt;&quot;Could the perpetrator in [Book] be other than what the book clearly implies?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  as a conjecture question, since it offers a thesis that runs counter to a straightforward reading of the book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Problem With Conjecture&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conjecture is the bread and butter of literary analysis -- finding interesting readings and interpretations and connections. Literary conjecture is clearly on-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I feel there's a problem with conjecture &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt;, with conjecture Q&amp;amp;A, as I see them on the site so far. It's something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poor&lt;/em&gt; conjecture questions are extremely easy to ask.&lt;/strong&gt; Any supposition, no matter how groundless or uninformed, can be phrased as a conjecture question. Additionally, conjecture questions can be extremely unclear is what it is that they are proposing -- for example, what is actually being requested by an &quot;Is [Character] gay?&quot; question?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor conjecture questions can be unclear on what they're looking for,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/1854/225&quot;&gt;have prompted answers&lt;/a&gt; explaining what the conjecture even &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, or could be, or should be. This makes sense if, wanting to give a substantial answer beyond &quot;your conjecture is wrong,&quot; the answerer needs to seek some version of the conjecture that can at least be debated.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor conjecture questions make the site look amateurish.&lt;/strong&gt; In bulk, conjecture questions that seem self-evidently groundless and uninformed, make the site look very bad - like a site for literary conspiracy theorists. Raising wild suppositions, in the hopes that someone will do something with them. Even if the poor ones get excellent &quot;No, there is no support for this proposition,&quot; the site is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; littered with posts going &quot;Is this random idea correct?&quot; &quot;No.&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor conjecture questions are hard to tell apart from good ones.&lt;/strong&gt; Literary analyses can turn black into white, and back again. While it is easy to say &quot;In my opinion, your conjecture is entirely unsupported by the text,&quot; it is very difficult to say &quot;--and nobody else can possibly draw a connection either.&quot; It's always conceivable you're missing something. This makes it difficult to vote to close or downvote a conjecture question -- what if it's a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; question, what if it might get an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; answer, and you just aren't seeing it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that works both ways. People can ask about conjecture that makes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of sense, but without explaining why -- after all, supporting or disproving the conjecture is what the &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to do. But bystanders who don't know the answer, can mistake these as being just as arbitrary and baseless as the poor type of conjecture question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the posts I've seen so far, I think this is a concern we should address. Happily, we have an excellent example in a sister site, which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had to deal with questions going &quot;I have a theory, &lt;em&gt;is it true?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; -- at Skeptics.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Skeptic.SE and Notability&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Skeptics.SE's &lt;a href=&quot;https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1505/faq-welcome-to-new-users&quot;&gt;site intro&lt;/a&gt; explains: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One area that is tricky for new users who ask questions, is that we aren't that interested in spending effort researching answers to ideas that no-one actually believes. We want to confirm or disprove real claims that many people think are true. Therefore, we ask that questions address &lt;strong&gt;notable claims&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Notable claims,&quot; on Skeptics.SE, means demonstrating that a claim is &lt;em&gt;believed by many&lt;/em&gt;, and/or &lt;em&gt;believed by somebody notable&lt;/em&gt;. (Note: this is not the method I'm proposing for us. :) )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3894/5610&quot;&gt;this explanation&lt;/a&gt; extremely clear, and ringing some familiar bells:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for the requirement for notability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't want to waste our time on claims invented by a couple of drunk guys at a bar. &quot;My buddy reckons a tiger could beat a&#xA;  hippopotamus in a fight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For that reason, we are looking for &quot;notable&quot; claims. Ideally,&#xA;  notable means believed by a significant number of people, but we also&#xA;  commonly use a short-cut. If you can find someone famous saying it, we&#xA;  assume that lots of people have heard it and a significant number&#xA;  believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get many questions by people who haven't understood the claim properly. They have misunderstood it - perhaps failed to see that it&#xA;  was satire. We like to be able to confirm the claim is being seriously&#xA;  made, and it is as described, so we don't spend effort writing&#xA;  arguments against straw men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we get bogged down in debates about definitions, having some context that we can use to root out what the original claimant meant&#xA;  by the claim can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can read their &lt;a href=&quot;https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/864/faq-must-all-questions-be-notable&quot;&gt;Notability FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for more details and related discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find Skeptics.SE's issues with notability to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; similar to our issues with unsupported conjecture. &lt;strong&gt;The assumption that something can be meaningfully discussed, on the grounds that somebody has asked to discuss it, can drag us towards overanalyzing trivialities&lt;/strong&gt; -- or, just a bunch of &quot;actually, that's pretty uninteresting&quot; answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Proposal: Explain support explicitly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Skeptics.SE uses notability, but I don't think that's what we want -- people coming up with new, original suggestions is fantastic for literary discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to see is &lt;strong&gt;explicit support&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are offering a conjecture to be evaluated by the community, &lt;strong&gt;I want to understand why this conjecture should be taken seriously.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Support can be many things. It can be references from the text, or things others have said about it, or details about the author's life. I don't think we can place any limits on what might constitute support. But there needs to be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's one immediate objection: &lt;em&gt;If OP can support their conjecture, what do they need to ask for?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And my answer, as much as I have one, is: OP doesn't need to support that their conjecture is &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;. But they should support that it's worth considering; that there's a question here with actual substance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this gives us a critical benefit: once support is made explicit, it becomes &lt;em&gt;much easier for the community to assess&lt;/em&gt;. If I can tell what the conjecture is based on, I can tell whether it's a solidly-grounded conjecture. If it's based on statements by others, I can get a better sense of what they said and what they meant. If I know what the OP is keying on to, I'm much more able to address what he's actually asking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that's what I would propose: &lt;strong&gt;Questions of conjecture, that do not explicitly offer support for their conjecture, should be closed.&lt;/strong&gt; I would go so far as to suggest this be a site-specific close reason - something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Questions requesting the proof or disproof of a claim, are required to demonstrate what support for the claim is already known, or context for why the question is being asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not proposing we define or limit what &quot;support&quot; should consist of. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insufficient&lt;/em&gt; support would not be cause to close a question - complete absence of support would be,&lt;/strong&gt; or not being able to tell what OP considers the support for his question. Once we know what support OP is relying on, we can upvote or downvote intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gives us the following clear guideline:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No support mentioned, or is it insufficiently clear what is meant to be the support for the conjecture? &lt;strong&gt;Vote to close.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Support is clearly outlined, and you think it's lousy support? &lt;strong&gt;On topic.&lt;/strong&gt; Downvote, comment, complain in chat about how Lit.SE is going to the dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Pros and Cons&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This proposal comes with an immediate price tag: it makes it harder to write questions, and it gives the community a new guideline we need to moderate and enforce. It also puts the question of &quot;What do you mean by 'support'? What constitutes 'good' support?&quot; front and center, as something we need to tackle anew with practically every question of this type. This can make our site less intuitive and welcoming to newcomers, as there will be additional, non-obvious rules for them to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that being said, &lt;strong&gt;I suspect we're going to be paying that price anyway.&lt;/strong&gt; My impression so far is the Conjecture Questions with no support are already met with mixed reactions -- some enthusiastic, some disapproving -- and that subsequent improvements to the question body, universally, have the OP adding context and support. In other words, it's a rule of thumb that these questions are improved by adding context/support - we're going to be suggesting people add those &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;. We're going to be dealing with these questions and these issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making the requirement explicit, establishing this as community policy, will give us a solid structure to offer OPs, and make the community's guidance clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.907" LastActivityDate="2018-02-01T04:50:09.903" Title="Proposal: Require explicit support for conjecture questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;close-reasons&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="12" FavoriteCount="3" />

Again, if there are complications which make its (in)validity unclear, then &lt;strong&gt;discuss that in the answer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Does the situation change at all if the works have different writers?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Does the situation change if it isn't supposed to be significant that the works share a universe (as opposed to stories in which the shared universe is of direct importance)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, these things could add extra complication to the situation, and again they should be taken account of in the full analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If all evidence points to one conclusion, and an answer is given, then an author releases another work which contradicts it, is the answer rendered invalid?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No: &lt;strong&gt;not invalid, only outdated.&lt;/strong&gt; If an answer provided an analysis which was complete at the time of writing, and then new evidence comes to light when the author releases a new book, then that answer is still a valid summary of the situation before that new book. It should then be edited to incorporate the new information - or, if for some reason this isn't done (e.g. if the answerer is no longer active on the site), somebody else could write up a new and more up-to-date answer. On this particular aspect of the issue, we could probably learn from the way SFF has dealt with similar problems: see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/9325/31394&quot;&gt;this meta post&lt;/a&gt; about obsolete answers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/7719/31394&quot;&gt;this earlier one&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. obsolete) answers.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say somebody asks whether, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/harry-potter&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;harry-potter&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;harry-potter&lt;/a&gt; series, Harry Potter is a Horcrux. The answer to this one is complicated, because Dumbledore (the wise mentor) says in the last book that he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a Horcrux, but J.K. Rowling (the author) has said in an interview that he is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/11546/31394&quot;&gt;SFF&lt;/a&gt;, this question would be answered by considering which of these two sources is a higher level of 'canon'. Here on Literature, a good answer would take &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; claims into account along with any other pertinent information, discuss the contradictions between them, and (perhaps) give reasons why one of them should be considered more reliable than the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example: it's well known that two of the Sherlock Holmes stories contradict each other on the issue of where Watson's war wound is located on his body. If somebody asked a question about this (OK, it would be a bit of a trivial question), a good answer would be &quot;the canon contradicts itself&quot;, supported by the two opposing quotes from the stories. I doubt there's any good reason to consider one more reliable than the other, but if there is, then a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good answer would also explain that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You get the picture. &lt;strong&gt;If there are contradictions, an answer shouldn't be partisan towards only one possible interpretation, but should address and discuss those contradictions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let's say we have contradictory evidence, drawn from a combination of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[long list]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How do we know how to prioritise these and come up with a satisfactory answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't prioritise them; cover them all!&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, if there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a reason to prioritise one over the other, then say so.

The question is deliberately phrased in terms of the influence on his works, which should place it very firmly on-topic despite involving details of his life outside of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When and why did the Brothers Grimm start collecting fairy tales?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The highest-voted question from the definition stage, this could be seen as more about the authors than their works. OK, it's about how their magnum opus came to be, but any answer would likely be about their real lives and not about literature per se. This question &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/23/17&quot;&gt;has been asked&lt;/a&gt; on the site, and is currently very highly-voted with no pending votes to close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Where did Margery Allingham talk about &quot;polishing her prose until it shone overbright&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This again seems to be more about an author than her works as such.

It seems that community opinion is in favour of questions about authors, &lt;strong&gt;at least provided they make &lt;em&gt;some effort&lt;/em&gt; to justify a connection with works of literature&lt;/strong&gt;. Your example doesn't, which may go some way towards explaining why it was so poorly received and quickly closed by three normal users and a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back on Area 51, I said that &quot;&lt;em&gt;questions about authors are more likely to be on-topic if phrased in terms of their works&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, and used the first of the examples considered above to illustrate this point: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Where exactly did Tolkien serve in WWI?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; might or might not be considered on-topic, but &quot;&lt;em&gt;How did his WWI experience influence Tolkien's writing?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; would surely be fine. Now I would probably rephrase my statement in terms of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; rather than scope&lt;/strong&gt;, and recommend downvoting rather than voting to close for questions about authors which aren't sufficiently clear in explaining a connection with works of literature. However, I'm open to being persuaded on this point - I realise we don't want the site to get overrun with random biographical questions about every author ever (did Tolkien drive, what's George RR Martin's favourite sandwich, how did JK Rowling do in maths at school, etc.), so if we start seeing too many of these, then maybe close-voting will have to be the way to go after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-03T08:41:05.823" LastActivityDate="2017-03-01T23:40:27.400" CommentCount="6" />

We've gotten a lot of questions that have been downvoted, and sometimes closed, sometimes not - and they all seem to share a common attribute: a lack of an explanation for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they were asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This criticism doesn't just appear on downvoted and ambiguously-closed questions - it also appears on questions that happen to be popular. But those questions are frequently ones that seem to be about commonly-known works, or books many people are familiar with, for which people are internally (but not explicitly) logicking through why someone would ask at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question was originally raised in my mind due to a specific breed of question - questions that, on the surface, aren't &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; relevant to the scope of literature, but about which it's reasonable to suspect that they were asked &lt;em&gt;because of&lt;/em&gt; literature. For example, questions about &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/543/are-questions-about-authors-personal-opinions-on-topic&quot;&gt;beliefs an author held&lt;/a&gt;, removed from the contexts of the books they wrote, are often directly relevant to the content of those works; but when asked in that way, doesn't appear on the surface level to be about literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These questions still &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on topic, in principle, though - if the point of this site is to create a resource where we can help each other better understand the written word, then such questions are definitely on topic, because what's behind them is usually some aim toward understanding the written word. &lt;strong&gt;But I don't think anyone would deny that they're missing something critically important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that missing thing may be &lt;em&gt;motivational context.&lt;/em&gt; What I'm talking about are a few questions that come to any reader's mind when they scan a querent's question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Why did you ask this?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What answer are you hoping to get?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How can I, as an answerer, actually address the question you're asking about?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and Probably Others, Too!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of questions to which this applies. As a literature site, we've already gotten a lot of questions about one-off theories - &quot;did [X] really happen?&quot; &quot;what was this author's opinion?&quot; - but it's not just these kinds of questions that could benefit from motivational context. Questions like, &quot;is [X] a reliable narrator?&quot; also need context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, whenever anyone comes to this site and asks a question, they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a reason for asking it. &lt;strong&gt;But missing that context hinders answerers and actually makes the question somewhat vague and even possibly downright unanswerable as written.&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding where a querent is coming from is critically important to properly addressing their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/536/proposal-require-explicit-support-for-conjecture-questions&quot;&gt;has been proposed by Standback before&lt;/a&gt;. Their question is &lt;em&gt;definitely worth reading&lt;/em&gt;, but this question is a little broader - this isn't just talking about conjecture questions, but more generally is a statement that all questions asked here benefit from motivational context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This can be a little hard to talk about, because examples are both thick in quantity and thin in quality. The ideal example would be a question that was missing context, was later edited to add context, and as a result, greatly improved. I'm still looking for an ideal example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; comment on a number of specific examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading order question - &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/788/what-order-should-i-read-thomas-pynchons-novels-in&quot;&gt;&quot;What order should I read Thomas Pynchon's novels in?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - Rand's comment here sums it up pretty well. The querent really needs to add information about why they think they should be reading this in a specific order at all, otherwise answerers are sort of at a loss for how to address the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reading order questions as a whole need to have a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; for being asked. Just taking any author's works and asking if there's an intended order isn't super helpful for anyone - clearly, something led the querent to believe there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an intended order, and if so, they should elucidate it so answers can properly address it. Here are some cheap, quick, easy-to-find examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good contextualization example - &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/1726/did-shakespeare-consider-julius-caesar-a-tyrant-or-a-martyr&quot;&gt;&quot;Did Shakespeare consider Julius Caesar a tyrant or a martyr?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - This has a clearly stated reason for being asked, a good justification and motivation, and as a result, it gained a clear answer exposing some of the details related to the author's experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I consider this a pretty clear case where having context for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something was asked directly lent itself to answers more properly addressing it. I consider this an effective example, if not close to ideal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Authorial intent question - &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/1054/how-do-people-eat-in-the-library-of-babel&quot;&gt;&quot;How do people eat in “The Library of Babel”?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - While this question is probably as good as it'll get just because of its content, it surely could have benefited from a more thorough description of what motivated the question. An answer would have been able to more tangibly address that. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Authorial intent question (a better one) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/293/did-a-specific-person-inspire-lord-byrons-poem-she-walks-in-beauty&quot;&gt;&quot;Did a specific person inspire Lord Byron's poem “She walks in beauty”?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Intertextuality question - &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/333/are-endymion-and-hyperion-by-john-keats-intended-to-be-related-pieces&quot;&gt;&quot;Are Endymion and Hyperion by John Keats intended to be related pieces?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - While &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; think this question is good, I had a very specific reason for proposing this on Area 51, which was that Dan Simmons' &lt;em&gt;Hyperion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Endymion&lt;/em&gt; duologies &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; connected. The question here doesn't contain any reason to believe that they're connected, which I think weakens it. It ultimately still received a reasonably good answer, though, a couple weeks later. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, is motivational context something we should require from questions?&lt;/strong&gt; (I mean where it's relevant.

It can't be actually empty? &lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(Physics)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is it true that Isaac Newton once drank a beer with horse dung in it for medicinal purposes? (I hope it was medicinal purposes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(History of Science and Mathematics)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last one still makes me laugh, but that's besides the point. All three questions have one of several problems, which is why they're all currently closed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It may be extremely unclear what the OP is saying. (Number 2) This &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be because of grammar, but in this case, nobody could figure out what the poster meant by &quot;force field&quot;, &quot;populating&quot;, or &quot;empty&quot;. Could there be a decent question there? Some would say no; some would say yes. But the question is poorly defined and poorly constrained.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It may be unclear what the OP's initial premise is, and how they got from that to the current question. (Number 3) For instance, the author did not know where they heard the initial claim or why anyone should care. Granted, people in Newton's time still had some embarrassing medical practices (leeches, anyone?), so it's not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; far-fetched, but we just have no clue where the OP got that idea, and why it should be taken seriously.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It may be that the question shows no research effort to an extreme degree. Now, &lt;strong&gt;lacking research effort is a reason to downvote, not close&lt;/strong&gt;. However, I've seen cases where the answer was so obvious that people were unsure why the OP was asking the question. Whether this is valid is (ironically) itself extremely unclear; there's no canonical policy that says it should be used. I wouldn't rule it out, and it does make questions worse, but I'd be uncomfortable using &quot;The answer's obvious&quot; as the only reason to close a question. Obvious is relative, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/116/71&quot;&gt;we're trying to embrace non-Googlers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A question doesn't have to have an obvious answer to show a lack of research effort. One-sentence bodies often fall into this category, even if the question itself may be appealing. The thought that comes to mind, though, is &quot;Why should I care?&quot; (Number 1) These are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/546/should-we-require-questions-to-contextualize-why-they-were-asked#comment1954_546&quot;&gt;&quot;I am curious&quot; questions&lt;/a&gt;, and they are not conducive to good answers because they are not well constrained.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that last bullet is my point. The problem with these questions is the answers (due to the question, of course, but the issue is manifested in the answers). In some cases, there will be answers that don't help the asker because the OP doesn't really tell us what they are truly confused about or want to know; this makes it easier to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/274942&quot;&gt;the XY Problem&lt;/a&gt;. Short questions are sometimes easy to interpret broadly; constraints will focus the answers and actually help people. If you don't add context, then &lt;strong&gt;the answers will lack this focus&lt;/strong&gt;. From there, it is clear that the question should be closed as Unclear (or possibly Too Broad).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if I don't know what the OP is thinking, can I really write a good answer? Maybe, in some cases, which is why I'm not in favor of a hardline, no-exceptions policy. However, I do think that we should require &lt;strong&gt;in most cases&lt;/strong&gt; that the OP explain their thought process fully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers to a question aren't always reasons to decide whether or not to close a question. However, we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have some close reasons network-wide that are based on what kind of answers the question will get:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;unclear what you're asking&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking. See the How to Ask page for help clarifying this question.&#xA;   too broad&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;too broad&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are either too many possible answers, or good answers would be too long for this format. Please add details to narrow the answer set or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;primarily opinion-based&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We already close questions on the basis of the answers they're likely to get. Closing questions without context both continue this philosophy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fit into at least one close reason (Unclear). I say that we should absolutely require questions to give some context for why they were asked. If not, I think close votes may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I'm not sure I fully agree with this policy; I feel that thoroughly searching for an answer on the Internet is part of good research.

I think this is a scenario which is likely to happen to new users. So my proposal is, could someone create some tags like novel, fiction or something like clarification, analysis etc. for cases when the corresponding author is not yet listed in the tags?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Okay, so I have been not clear enough so I would make another attempt:   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe there is a problem with how tags work on this site. And the problem is, that if a new user wants to ask a question about a book or author that does not have a tag yet, might be scared off from writing that question when they do not find an appropriate tag (as choosing a tag is mandatory). This might suggest that a new member is not allowed to write a question about different books/authors other than that's already been asked. We could be possibly losing new members.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for this reason, I would suggest, that a general 'novel' tag is created (there are already tags for short-story and poetry) so it can be chosen by someone who does not have a reputation to create tags.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In the description of the 'novel' tag could be explained that it is only to be chosen when no other tag fits.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And when a higher ranking member edits the question, they could create a tag for the mentioned author/book and delete the 'novel' tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One remark: As far as I am concerned it does not have to be the exact tag 'novel'. It could be something else like 'fiction' too. It was just an example. I just wanted to point out that there is a problem which restricts how members under 150 reputation can use the site and I believe that the consequences can be graver than intended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I would like to clarify why I think this question is &lt;strong&gt;not a duplicate&lt;/strong&gt;.       &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other question was asked during the private beta when everyone could create tags, this is not the case anymore&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My question is not really a discussion starter, but a feature request (as the tag clearly states)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But let's assume for a moment that it is a duplicate. Then I would guess that the answers from this other question stand in this case too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 2 answers:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1. The first one says that the OP should create a new tag for the book if they find it fitting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So if the OP thinks the work they are asking about merits a titular tag, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in my case, the OP is &lt;strong&gt;not able&lt;/strong&gt; to create a tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The second one says that everyone can create a tag as they see fitting, and we should clean up later. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I try to look at tagging as a kind of lazy topiary: let them grow however they want until they get in the way of the path, then trim 'em back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So none of these answers are against creating a 'novel' tag.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you are &lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt; creating the 'novel' tag then please &lt;strong&gt;create a new answer&lt;/strong&gt; as to why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you still think this question &lt;strong&gt;is a duplicate&lt;/strong&gt;, because the 'novel' tag should be allowed (I do not see why not, as there are 'poetry' and 'short-story' tags too) then &lt;strong&gt;please do create this tag&lt;/strong&gt; for the sake of novice users.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As stated before, this question tries to be a &lt;em&gt;feature request&lt;/em&gt; (for the very simple reason I am not allowed to create a new tag) and not a discussion starter.

This event impacts her life far more than the immediate distress it causes her, or even than the short-lived child resulting from her subsequent pregnancy: it's one of the defining moments of her tragic life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The big question is &lt;strong&gt;to what extent their sexual relationship was consensual&lt;/strong&gt;. It was already established that he was attempting to seduce her and she, despite not returning his feelings, was too inexperienced to know how to deal with him. But did she allow herself to be persuaded to consent to sex with him, or did he actually force himself on her? &lt;strong&gt;Was she raped, or merely seduced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was then &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/posts/1907/revisions&quot;&gt;edited&lt;/a&gt; by moderator &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/111/hamlet&quot;&gt;Hamlet♦&lt;/a&gt; to read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first part of Thomas Hardy's &lt;em&gt;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&lt;/em&gt; ends on an extremely dark and sinister note.

It was already established that Alec was attempting to seduce her, and that she, despite not returning his feelings, was too inexperienced to know how to deal with him.

The victim blaming in this question distracts from the actual issue at hand, because it is demeaning to victims of sexual assault. I don't want to get sidetracked; I don't want the question to devolve into a rebuttal of the  problematic understanding of consent in the question. I want to focus on the actual question at hand, which is about interpreting a scene in a work of literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my edits, I tried to keep the question intact while removing the problematic language.

Our goal is to build a repository of great questions and answers about literature, and (for the most part) we shouldn't care where those questions and answers come from. If someone asks an interesting and on-topic question about literature, let's not close it just because it came from the OP's homework assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, such a policy would be counter-productive. Since we often can't tell whether a particular question came from homework or not, any OP who wanted to sneak their homework question past an anti-homework policy could easily do so just by not admitting it was a homework question. If there was a particular &lt;em&gt;type of question&lt;/em&gt; under consideration here, as opposed to simply a particular place of origin, then this argument wouldn't hold water; but I don't think there is. Homework questions can be either good or bad, regardless of their origins or inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are some potential issues which could arise from such questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plagiarism.&lt;/strong&gt; If people copy questions word-for-word from literature tests without crediting the original author, that could be a problem for our site. The users and moderators here wouldn't bear any legal responsibility - DMCA takedown notices are handled by Stack Exchange the company - but legal issues aren't something we want Literature SE to get involved with on any level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/referencing&quot;&gt;help centre page&lt;/a&gt; on plagiarism and how to reference external material, which is highly relevant here. If people credit the original source, or (even better) rewrite the question in their own words rather than copy-pasting, this problem will be greatly diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheating.&lt;/strong&gt; Ethically, we don't really want to help people cheat; on the other hand, the arguments I made above, about evaluating questions on their own merits regardless of where they came from, are still valid. For a reasonable compromise, I suggest we use the same policy as &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/a/16775&quot;&gt;Maths SE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/1675/5373&quot;&gt;Puzzling SE&lt;/a&gt;: close/lock/delete all questions from &lt;em&gt;ongoing timed contests&lt;/em&gt; (are there such contests in literature?), and restore them once the contest is over. That way, we avoid helping people cheat, but still end up with useful content preserved on our site for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice&quot;&gt;Be Nice&lt;/a&gt; policy still applies. Leaving a comment like &quot;hey, is this a homework question?&quot; is OK, but saying &quot;you filthy cheat, you're too lazy to do your own homework&quot; isn't. (Not that I'm expecting to see many comments of the latter type here on Literature; this advice is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/334823&quot;&gt;these Stack Overflow guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.) We should assume good faith unless there's good reason not to, and in the latter case let the moderators deal with it. Conversely, of course, OPs asking homework questions should be honest about doing so, and abide by their school or university's policy.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;References and related reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/334822/how-do-i-ask-and-answer-homework-questions&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow's policy&lt;/a&gt; on homework questions (migrated from main meta)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/106/what-is-the-proper-way-to-handle-homework-questions&quot;&gt;Maths SE's policy&lt;/a&gt; on homework questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/16774/contest-problem-policy&quot;&gt;Maths SE's policy&lt;/a&gt; on ongoing-contest questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5958/bite-sizing-homework/&quot;&gt;Physics SE's policy&lt;/a&gt; on what kinds of homework questions are on-topic&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/714/how-do-i-ask-homework-questions-on-physics-stack-exchange&quot;&gt;Physics SE's policy&lt;/a&gt; on asking homework questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.puzzling.stackexchange.com/q/1674/5373&quot;&gt;Puzzling SE's policy&lt;/a&gt; on ongoing-contest questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3322/31394&quot;&gt;Science Fiction &amp;amp; Fantasy SE's policy&lt;/a&gt; on homework questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="11" LastEditDate="2017-04-23T17:29:56.570" LastActivityDate="2017-04-23T17:29:56.570" CommentCount="6" />

Indeed, there is one question where &lt;em&gt;Tissue&lt;/em&gt; is one of 15 poems we may be asked about. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;compare&lt;/em&gt; question&lt;/strong&gt;, and you're not supposed to think on your feet (see mark scheme below).

Anyone will have access to your observations, and I wasn't asking you to produce a polished comparison essay, but a few bullet points about POWER in &lt;em&gt;Tissue&lt;/em&gt;. Here are a few subjects (of the 15-poem question) that the teachers have pointed out as likely: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power of Humans, Power of Nature, Effects of Conflict, Reality of Conflict, Loss and Absence, Memory, Negative Emotion [anger/guilt/fear/pride], Identity, Individual Experiences.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Compare how the writer presents X (e.g. Identity) in X (e.g. &lt;em&gt;My Last Duchess&lt;/em&gt;), and one other poem from your &lt;em&gt;Power and Conflict&lt;/em&gt; anthology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 14 other poems are well-known, interesting, and discussable in class - e.g, &lt;em&gt;Ozymandias&lt;/em&gt; - but &lt;em&gt;Tissue&lt;/em&gt; is five times more demanding, and has lots of strange concepts which are harder to break down. This is from the 2018 GCSE syllabus, with mock exams in May/June of this year and next year. The 15-poems question is 45 minutes. You are given one of the poems you've studied, but you have to compare it to another one that you &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anything that doesn't answer the question gets no marks. E.g, I once said &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt;, Owen uses the first-person plural pronoun 'we' to present the soldier's opinion as universal, whereas the writer of &lt;em&gt;Bayonet Charge&lt;/em&gt; uses the third-person singular pronoun 'he' to make it sound like one man's story.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was irrelevant to &quot;how the writer presents the power of nature&quot;, so that point was worth 0. &lt;em&gt;No-one will get away with parroting random points about the poem,&lt;/em&gt; such as POWER, which is the only think I'm asking for help with. The exam is designed to more sophisticated now. You cannot get more than a level 3 (grade D) for doing that even if the question is about power. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some links to the real specification: &lt;a href=&quot;http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/english/AQA-87022-SMS.PDF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here for poetry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/english/AQA-8702-EX-COMMENTARY.PDF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here for exemplar responses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/english/gcse/english-language-8700/subject-content&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here for examiners' assessment objectives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, read my paraphrased specification.

Most of us have read many of the same books, and so many of the questions we get are... about those books specifically. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/tags&quot;&gt;top site tags&lt;/a&gt; betrays this bias: look past the generic tags, and you run face-first into George Orwell, 1984, Sherlock Holmes, JRR Tolkien, Arthur Conan Doyle, Harper Lee, William Golding, and Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This bias is derivative from the culture in which most of us grew up. Even across country lines, in English-speaking countries, many of the books that are considered &quot;important&quot; and &quot;literary&quot; are shared. We also may or may not be pulling some to much of this from Scifi Stack Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's a whole lot of literature out there sitting in topics we're not even touching. It's not that we're intentionally avoiding those areas - it's just that the way we've been taught to read has passively encouraged us to avoid books that are too far out from what we're used to. And the body of works that are deemed &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;literary&quot; by our culture is, despite its harsh limitation, so broad that one could spend decades reading and still not finish. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an issue for our site. Ultimately, a literature site is best served by being multicultural and pluralistic, rather than beset by an unconscious, unintentional, and very historical bias toward one category alone. Hamlet has remarked that this narrowing could be a serious risk to the site's health if it goes unaddressed, I think they may be correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's hardly going to be a quick fix... but I had an idea.&lt;/strong&gt; At least as first steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of sites have topic challenges. These sites have a meta post where people answer with suggestions for what the next topic challenge could be, and when the next one rolls around, the top answer is picked and a new topic challenge is born. For the duration of the challenge, people post questions and answers pertaining to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of a variation of this for Literature.SE. &lt;strong&gt;How about we create a topic challenge dedicated &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; to content that fall well outside of what we normally read?&lt;/strong&gt; Each month (month? discuss:), we pick the top answer, which has been selected by the community for its diversification, either culturally, structurally, or really in any positive way, and those of us who wish to do so go ahead and read it. It can be anything - oral tradition, mythology, fantasy, philosophy, you name it - as long as there's enough there to reasonably fill a casual month with reading, it's good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We'd want to strongly encourage people to upvote books &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; than what they normally read, and to let be in peace answers that are pretty similar to books they've read in the past. We'd also want, perhaps, to encourage content that's challenging to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There would be very few good reasons to downvote suggestions - maybe if they weren't large enough to reasonably fill a month, or if it's excessively difficult to get ahold of a copy of the book, or if it's not just hard but downright inaccessible as a text from outside the culture. (Though we have to be careful - books from different cultures are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; harder both to get ahold of and to understand. We don't want to end up discouraging them.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is, at minimum, a good step toward addressing the quiet and surreptitious narrowing of the scope of the site. At the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; minimum, actually getting our hands on multicultural books is the first step in learning how to handle and talk about these issues better, so it has to be our starting point. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2017-03-12T05:37:41.953" LastActivityDate="2017-03-12T05:37:41.953" Title="Do we want something akin to topic challenges for books outside our bailiwick, to help alleviate the book diversity problem?"

I look forward to seeing more Rūmī (13th-century Persian poet) and Albert Wendt (contemporary Samoan poet and novelist) on the site!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I'd like to add that building a diverse and multicultural scope must include more than seeking out the &quot;important&quot; works from other cultures: simultaneously we need to also seek out marginalised works that haven't made it into the literary canon. Many of the works we're asking questions about, we know because knowing them is a signal of good repute. It impresses people if we can reference Robert Frost, and recognising a Tolkien quote signals that we're part of the same clan as the person who recited it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I encourage us to look outside the sphere of referential reputation in whatever culture we cast our gaze upon. Maybe nobody will get erudition points for quoting Robert Hayden (though we should; he was a notable Poet Laureate) but his poems are powerful and challenging and it will be rewarding to study them all the same. And maybe it's not a cultural touchstone, but I really want to read &lt;em&gt;The Sea is Ours&lt;/em&gt; (an anthology of Southeast Asian steampunk stories by Southeast Asian authors) because it's part of a brand-new, consciously cultivated subgenre that's fascinating to watch grow in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn't to say we shouldn't be reading Iraj Pezeškzâd (author of one of the most beloved Iranian novels in the last fifty years) or Kazuo Ishiguro (award-winning Japanese-British novelist) also.

IMHO, we could just close those questions as &quot;unclear what you're asking&quot; or &quot;primarily opinion-based&quot; (which they are if it's not possible to write an answer you can support with some kind of evidence).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that the following heuristic would be valuable here: is it possible to write an answer that can be supported with specific evidence? If not, it should be closed as primarily opinion-based.

As that blog post states,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h1&gt;From this point on, meta-tagging is explicitly discouraged.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean that you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; do it. On Worldbuilding, we've flat-out flouted the rules with three tags: &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/science-based&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;science-based&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;science-based&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reality-check&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reality-check&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reality-check&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hard-science&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hard-science&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hard-science&lt;/a&gt;. I like to think that they've worked, on the whole, and I've fought for &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hard-science&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hard-science&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hard-science&lt;/a&gt; for almost two years now. It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;I don't always support meta tags&lt;/strong&gt;. I supported &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hard-science&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hard-science&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hard-science&lt;/a&gt; because it addressed a major problem, namely, a lack of rigor in many answers which ended up disappointing a decent amount of people. So we consciously took action. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Still_a_Few_Bugs_in_the_System.html?id=OOHKAQAACAAJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;still a few bugs in the system&lt;/a&gt;, to quote Garry Trudeau, but on the whole, things are good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/academia&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;academia&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt; tag is different. We don't have a huge expert contingent, true, but creating a tag won't change that. At the same time, having the tag will - and I mean &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;, because it's happened occasionally with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hard-science&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hard-science&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hard-science&lt;/a&gt; tag - discourage people from posting high-quality answers on questions which don't use the tag. If you use it too much, folks start to think that any questions which &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; have the tag shouldn't get really high-level explanations. And that's often flat-out not true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in summary:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I vote yes for creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/philology&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;philology&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;philology&lt;/a&gt; tag (as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linguistics&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linguistics&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;history&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;) and seeing how things go from here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I vote no for creating an &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/academia&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;academia&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt; tag or other meta tags.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="71" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T16:44:26.520" LastActivityDate="2017-03-09T18:36:08.623" CommentCount="2" />

I was more referring to cases where the author's claims are based on dubious interpretations of the text and/or things that weren't clearly addressed in the text. For example, if an author releases a character sketch (especially long after the fact when it's difficult to tell whether that's actually what the author had in mind when he/she wrote the book), is it valid to use that as evidence as to what the book means?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Items #2 and #3 are much more specific instances of what #1 is talking about.

  <row Id="596" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2017-03-12T05:37:33.900" Score="27" ViewCount="1706" Body="&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/571/&quot;&gt;asked about starting up reading challenges&lt;/a&gt;, with a particular goal in mind. Many of our questions are about the same authors, the same stories, the same genres, the same cultures. This isn't anyone's fault - it's just the way we were raised to read. We tend to pick out books that are &quot;literary&quot; or widely-recognized within our own cultures and our own personal reading scopes. But in reality, this restriction is harshly limiting on cultural and literary exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the reasoning behind topic challenges at that meta post. Here's what it boils down to: as first steps toward alleviating the breadth problem of Literature.SE, we're going to start reading challenges, similar to topic challenges on other sites (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pets.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1945/&quot;&gt;Pets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gardening.meta.stackexchange.com/q/595/&quot;&gt;Gardening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/1768/&quot;&gt;Worldbuilding&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.meta.stackexchange.com/q/211/&quot;&gt;Sustainable Living&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our reading challenges are typically going to last one month&lt;/strong&gt;, unless a particular suggestion specifies otherwise, which they're certainly free to do. While this is much longer than other Stack sites typically do, this should allow us to read and approach a topic at a casual pace, while not too harshly limiting the number of topics we'll get to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Guidelines for Voting On a Reading Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voting on these challenges is pretty simple, but &lt;strong&gt;make sure you do it with care and thought.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the post fulfills the spirit of the reading challenge, and does indeed offer exposure to culture or thought that many people might not otherwise see, we'd suggest voting up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the post does not fulfill the spirit of the reading challenge, and does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; offer exposure to new culture or thought, then we'd suggest voting down. And maybe leave a comment about why you're not sure it's a helpful challenge suggestion, because it's possible someone just misunderstood the purpose behind this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Guidelines for Suggesting a Reading Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your challenge suggestion can be... honestly, whatever you'd like it to be. &lt;strong&gt;Please do make challenges that fall outside of what users of the site might predominantly already read. That's sort of why we're doing this.&lt;/strong&gt; (It's also worth bearing in mind that these challenges are less a tool of study, and more a tool of intersectional exposure.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice we expect to see mostly three categories: specific books, authors, and genres. The following aren't hard and fast rules, but are worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you create a &lt;strong&gt;book challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, please consider doing the following:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the book(s) is/are reasonably available. Books from other cultures are a priori harder to obtain in English-speaking countries, so there's a good bit of slack here. But make sure that it's still possible to obtain a copy of it at all. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a book is from another language, ensure that the translator of that book is &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the country of origin of that book. This isn't a requirement, but in order to preserve the meaning of a translated text, it's magnitudes better to have a copy translated by someone within the culture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Describe the sort of prior knowledge you think would be helpful have before/during reading the book. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Please be mindful of the difficulty some texts pose. If a text would be valuable to study, but has a knowledge and time barrier that makes the book unreasonably difficult to delve into for someone outside of it, it may not be a good fit for a reading challenge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Please remember that the minimum age for the site is 13, and a percentage of our users are young, so please, within reason, attempt to suggest books that are not too graphic, or contain inordinate amounts of strong language. This doesn't mean that the book can't have language, but please keep this in mind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you create an &lt;strong&gt;author challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, please consider doing the following:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Briefly describe what about the author motivated you to suggest them here. this doesn't have to be long, but it's helpful to have some more context so that people get a better sense for why you'd suggest it here. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;List around 2-4 of the books by the author that you think are particularly important or relevant, and maybe if it's not immediately clear, how they tie into your motivation for the author. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If an author doesn't have very many published books, their works may be more suited for a book challenge. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you create a &lt;strong&gt;genre challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, please consider doing the following:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Highlight a reasonable number (3-5ish) of recommended authors who have written works in that genre. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Highlight one or two of each author's books, as per the above advice. This might seem like a lot of work, but your answer is going to serve as a starting point for people to discover what they want to read in this genre. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you think your topic challenge is suited for a time period different than one month, you're welcome to indicate this in your answer. One month is sort of the assumed default; one week challenges might be an easier sell, longer than one month might make it a fairly hard sell.

Some of her work borders on fantasy or horror, but more than falling into the standard genre tropes, Fowler's work often touches on the numinous, the ineffable, the impossible. Whether she does that within genre our without, the result is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think of Fowler as a literary genre writer -- she breathes depth, nuance and insight into fields where you'd hardly expect them. And she's a master of characterizations and detail -- so often, individual paragraphs feel like complete stories in and of themselves, giving you a vivid portrait with just a few well-chosen details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notable books include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Jane Austen Book Club&lt;/strong&gt;: Six friend read Jane Austen together -- each their own character, each with their own interpretation of Austen; and each finds reflections of Austen in their own tumultuous lives.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;: A portrait of a dysfunctional family.

It is set in England and the basic premise is that Elizabeth I was assassinated before she could establish her rule. The Spanish invaded and the Reformation was suppressed throughout Europe. The use of electricity has been outlawed by the Pope, and so technology is basically that of Victorian England.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not a steam-punk novel. Rather, it is a collection of loosely interconnected stories that only come together at the end of the book, and describes the struggles of various characters as they cope with the strange version of England that they find themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At about 200 pages, it is an easy read, and it can be picked up on Amazon Marketplace relatively cheaply. Note that one chapter, &lt;em&gt;The White Boat&lt;/em&gt;, is not included in all editions, and it is not clear (at least on Amazon) which editions include it (my copy doesn't).

Now that we've reached a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/363/17&quot;&gt;rough consensus&lt;/a&gt; that we should be using, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russian-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;russian-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;russian-literature&lt;/a&gt; on all questions even about individual works of Russian literature, these tags provide an easy way in to the tagging system for new users without enough rep to create their own tags.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, if someone asks a question about a long novel by a French author who doesn't have a tag yet, they can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/french-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;french-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;french-literature&lt;/a&gt; tag (which the question &lt;em&gt;should have anyway&lt;/em&gt;) and wait for someone else to create the author/work tags for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that this is what &lt;em&gt;actually happened&lt;/em&gt; in the case that motivated this meta post - Ash ended up posting her question with just the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/american-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;american-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;american-literature&lt;/a&gt; tag. So this seems like a practical and workable solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if the relevant tag even for the whole body of literature doesn't exist yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been generally against using tags such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/english-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;english-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;english-literature&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/american-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;american-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;american-literature&lt;/a&gt;, since by default (this being an English-language site) the majority of our questions will fall into these categories.

Obviously we shouldn't take every answer from an author to be &quot;Word of God&quot;, the definitive final answer to the question ... but on the other hand, the author can, at least in some contexts, tell us things that nobody else could. A lot of this is going to depend on the nature of the &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; as well as just the text of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;pure analysis question which relies heavily on interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;, an answer from the author isn't going to be worth much more than an answer from anyone else. Saying &quot;X means Y, because I'm the author and I intended X to mean Y&quot; would be a bad answer, but saying &quot;X can be interpreted as meaning Y, because [blah blah blah, sensible analysis]&quot; would be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think I really need to give examples here. The issue of how much an author's statement is worth has already been &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2009/17&quot;&gt;gone over&lt;/a&gt; ad nauseam on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a question which asks about authorial intent, or about some other aspect of a literary work which &lt;strong&gt;the author would be likely to know better than anyone else&lt;/strong&gt; (let's remember that &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/283/17&quot;&gt;this site isn't just for analysis questions&lt;/a&gt;), an answer from the author &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be treated differently from an answer from just some random SE user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we had a question like &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/1990/17&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; about a work by an author who was still alive, and they signed up to the site to tell us about the parallels between their own childhood and that of their character, that could be a really good answer which &lt;em&gt;nobody else would be qualified to write.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, I think there's a simple rule of thumb to determine how, if at all, an answer by the author should be treated differently from any other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine the author had been interviewed, said exactly what's in this answer, and the interview had been published. Would just quoting from that interview make a reasonable answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the first case, of an interpretation-based analysis question. An author might have given an interview in which they state that they intended X to mean Y; just quoting this wouldn't make a good answer. Or they might have justified in the interview why X meaning Y makes sense, in which case (if their argument is good enough) quoting this could make a decent answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the second case, of a question which the author is more qualified to answer than anyone else. If they've already answered it in an interview, then the contents of that interview could be turned into a reasonable answer on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's true that the Stack Exchange platform isn't designed for hosting interviews with experts, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; designed for getting answers from experts to good questions, and interviews can sometimes be &lt;em&gt;quoted&lt;/em&gt; in order to form decent Stack Exchange answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/2103/17&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/959/17&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, I've included quotes from authorial interviews as part of a broader analysis of a topic. If Art Spiegelman or Richard Adams had posted those answers, with the textual-analysis parts exactly the same and the authorial-interview parts replaced by simple statements rather than linked quotes, the answers would be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;exactly as valid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as mine are.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;There's still the issue of &lt;strong&gt;verifying that an author really is who they claim to be&lt;/strong&gt;. I mean, anyone could sign up under the username &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot; and post troll answers to questions about the Harry Potter books. I've already addressed this issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/9620/31394&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;No personally identifying information about SE users is publicly visible. And beyond making off-site contact with the celebrity themselves (which is a possibility and has been done in the past), such information is the only way of proving a user is who they say they are. So, if you find someone who claims to be a specific actor, author, etc. and you're doubtful about their claim, feel free to flag the post for moderator attention. The mods are the only people who have a chance of verifying a user's identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases (such as with the question from @Mithrandir linked in the OP), the author could confirm elsewhere, e.g. using their official Twitter account, that the answer really is from them. And if you're unsure, you can always raise a flag and ask the mods to check.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this only matters in cases where it makes a difference whether or not the answer is really from the author. If someone claims to be the author and posts a decent analysis which would stand on its own, no need to check. If someone makes claims &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the author while claiming to be them, and those claims are crucial to the answer, then a check might be wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:18.390" LastActivityDate="2017-03-20T18:33:51.873" CommentCount="3" />

Sure, I can totally agree that that's not what we're here for. There are many other sites that rock that sort of author interaction, and we're not here for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I think there is a large difference between &quot;hey I wrote this thing! I have a unique perspective because it came out of my head!&quot; and effectively doing an AMA thing using SE's platform. If the author can come in, and write a super excellent answer held to the same standards as any other answer on this site, why not? And if we can demonstratively prove they are who they say they are, that's kinda neat, no? (Bonus points if we can make them stick around and be more active, because more people is always awesome).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think we should turn away authors of works, if they choose to grace us with their presence. After all, if they came in and wrote an awesome answer and didn't state they were the author, we'd be like HOLY MOLY THIS IS GREAT HAVE AN UPVOTE. I don't see why this should change if we manage to prove they are who they say they are - after all, the beauty of the SE system is that we can have multiple answers, so even if the author comes in and says the thing is x because y, it is completely possible someone else could come in and go &quot;what about x being because of z&quot; and if they manage to make a good strong case for it backed up by the text or whatever else, that's awesome too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the author is going to be the right expert for the job at hand, sometimes they won't be.

There are a lot of red herrings in this discussion, and it's become a bit of a mess. It's starting to hinder our ability to talk about this cleanly. Ignore quality, author validation, and all the rest for now; that's putting the cart before the horse. Let's talk about that later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, let's focus instead just on the relationship of an author to their work. Albeit this is more complicated and thorny than I'd like it to be, let's delineate Questions a User Can Ask into two &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.smu.edu/nschwart/seminar/fallacy.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;subtly different&lt;/a&gt; categories:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about what the author &lt;em&gt;meant to say&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about what &lt;em&gt;meaning the text conveys&lt;/em&gt; (and other textual questions)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The author has the power to write the work however they'd like; often, authors will have a goal in mind when doing so. &lt;strong&gt;Authors therefore have primacy over questions of intent.&lt;/strong&gt; An author's answer stating, &quot;I am the author, and I intended to [have Sam lob an expensive mango at Susan]&quot; is sufficient to establish what the author &lt;em&gt;intended to write&lt;/em&gt;. This should be an acceptable answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authors, however, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have the power to absolutely determine what meaning the text conveys. The meaning of the text is the meaning as interpreted by the reader, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; by the author. Understanding the meaning of a text requries evidence, thought, analysis, and cultural critique. &lt;strong&gt;Authors therefore do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have primacy over questions of meaning and interpretation.&lt;/strong&gt; If an author wants to answer one of these questions, that's great! They're probably one of the most qualified people to do so. But they &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; need to provide the same level of evidence and analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The critical point is this: if an author answers a question of &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; with a statement of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, they have given a non-answer to the question.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quality is a separate issue. An author providing a statement of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; without textual evidence to show where it comes through is missing something important. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an answer to the question, but it may or may not be a very good one; questions of intent are better when they're supported by textual and meta-textual evidence. &lt;strong&gt;We should &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt; authors to provide as much information and evidence as possible, because it will make their answer better&lt;/strong&gt; - but it isn't a strict requirement. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things that are red herrings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Validating an author's identity.

A great deal of things are implied by the word &quot;interview,&quot; very few of which concern the purpose of this question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things that might be confusing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Primacy isn't authority. An author's answer &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; mean their response is guaranteed to be correct. It has happened in the past, albeit relatively infrequently, that the consensus about an author's intent differs sharply from their stated intent.

From Quora, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A symbol is something that represents something else, usually greater than itself (e.g., a tree can be a symbol of life).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Allegories are narratives that have a symbolic meaning, like fables or parables.They represent some aspect of life, or life itself, and contain symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Aesop's fable of the ant and the grasshopper is an allegory of the importance of hard work and planning for the future. The ant is a symbol of industry and prevision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it seems that both are based on the same idea (one thing representing another), but an allegory is an entire story set up to symbolise something different, while a symbol is more likely to be an object within the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;... but we've been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; in a very broad way.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our questions tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; include not only ones about symbolic objects (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2214/17&quot;&gt;What does the sukebind represent?&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/1928/17&quot;&gt;What is the greater meaning of the thrush?&lt;/a&gt;) but also ones about symbolism on a wider scale: symbolism of actions, events, or even entire works, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/1804/17&quot;&gt;What is the significance of the fact that the covered wagons were traveling East at the end of Atlas Shrugged?&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2178/17&quot;&gt;Is there any deeper significance to Borges&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The South&amp;quot;?&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2201/17&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s the significance of the witches&amp;#39; name change in Sandman?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were some recent comments about this sort of issue between myself, Hamlet, and DVK on one of my questions, but they seem to have been deleted. If I recall correctly, Hamlet was arguing that &quot;symbolism&quot; should only refer to symbolic objects and not to actions or events. But the usage so far of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; tag (our most used tag!) tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, one of the two &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/allegory&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;allegory&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;allegory&lt;/a&gt; questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2249/17&quot;&gt;What did the Roll which the Shining Ones delivered to Christian represent?&lt;/a&gt;, is actually about what is represented by a particular &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt;, so I doubt anyone would disagree that it should be tagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the question is: &lt;strong&gt;do we want to differentiate between allegory and symbolism in our tags?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having two separate tags for these two notions would require explaining the difference clearly in the tag wiki excerpts, editing probably a few dozen existing questions, and continuing to retag new questions as they come in because many people still won't get the difference between allegory and symbolism. Rolling the two into one would be more consistent with existing practice and would make curation easier going forwards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And after all, the two concepts &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; closely related: we're not talking about putting two completely different things under the same header just for ease of administration. Actions, events, or entire stories can be &lt;em&gt;symbolic&lt;/em&gt; even if it would be strange to refer to them as &lt;em&gt;symbols&lt;/em&gt;; and the name of the main tag is &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbols&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbols&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, we should definitely keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/allegory&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;allegory&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;allegory&lt;/a&gt; as a synonym, so that people who type &lt;code&gt;allegory&lt;/code&gt; into the tag box will use the right tag rather than recreating a different one over and over again.

A losing game of chance with a mysterious stranger seems like a dream to young King Tamar, but the iron ring on his finger is a very real token that his life may be forfeit. A journey to the stranger's distant kingdom seems his only chance to discover the truth. Many adventures and diversions crop up along the way as Tamar gains some surprising companions, including a brave and beautiful milkmaid, a cowardly eagle, and a wiley monkey king who used to be a man. The author's flexible style moves smoothly from comedy to tragedy and back again; from battle scenes to ridiculous situations, Alexander never loses the thread. Set within the action are small gems of poetry and folktales. The concept of dharma, or proper conduct, and the rigid caste system deeply affect Tamar's actions. Plot, characters, and setting all have their parts to play, but it is the tension set up among the lively characters and the cultural conventions binding them that create the structure of the story and lead inevitably to its conclusion. This wise and witty adventure can be enjoyed on many levels.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/773693.The_Iron_Ring&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this is such a well-known book, and I haven't seen any questions about this yet.

With the possible exception of Icelandic, they are not only mutually intelligible to any native speaker but probably have &lt;strong&gt;less variation between them than there is variation &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; Norwegian&lt;/strong&gt; between different regional dialects. What's more, the Scandinavian countries themselves were all one until just a couple of hundred years ago; any cultural differences between the three (again, more significant differences than exist between one Norwegian valley and another) are likely to be recent inventions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we have to take their ancestor language Old Norse into consideration. There is a body of literature written in this language, and it's probably impossible to draw a clear line between where Old Norse stops and the modern Scandinavian language(s) begin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking all this into account, I see a few different possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;separate tags for &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/norwegian-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;norwegian-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;norwegian-literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/swedish-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;swedish-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;swedish-literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/danish-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;danish-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;danish-literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/icelandic-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;icelandic-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;icelandic-literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/finnish-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;finnish-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;finnish-literature&lt;/a&gt;, and I suppose &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/norse-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;norse-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;norse-literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a single &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scandinavian-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scandinavian-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scandinavian-literature&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/norse-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;norse-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;norse-literature&lt;/a&gt;?) tag to cover all four modern Scandinavian languages &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Old Norse, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/finnish-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;finnish-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;finnish-literature&lt;/a&gt; separate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;shove the whole lot under &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nordic-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;nordic-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;nordic-literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there aren't many questions yet about Nordic literature, this issue may become very relevant next month if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/649/17&quot;&gt;Icelandic sagas&lt;/a&gt; make it to our next topic challenge.

The poster child here is likely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Holberg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ludvig Holberg&lt;/a&gt;, a playwright who lived between 1684 and 1754, born in (present) Norway but lived most of his life in (present) Denmark. However, most significant authors are easy to assign to a country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other case are Swedish-speaking authors living in Finland. They are a significant minority, and have produced a number of important authors. Most well known is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Jansson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tove Jansson&lt;/a&gt;. There are also Finnish-speaking people in Sweden, but they have not the same kind of independent tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any problem in assigning an author to Sweden or Norway is going to be due to the person, not the personal union 1814-1905. Norway was largely autonomous, and it would be an even worse blunder to call Ibsen a Swede than it would be to label someone from Edinburgh &quot;English&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are only a very few edge cases where there is likely to be a genuine difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Modern literature&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, it makes good sense to group modern Scandinavian authors and works together; it takes very little work for anyone from Denmark, Norway or Sweden to read the other languages, Icelanders and Faroese usually speak &quot;Scandinavian&quot;, and many Finns learn Swedish in school, if they do not have it as their mother tongue. Further, there is a strong common tradition. As Finnish literature is also commonly included in this group (see e.g. Wikipedia's page &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_literature&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scandinavian literature&lt;/a&gt;, and consider that the existence of things like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Council%27s_Literature_Prize&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nordic council's literature prize&lt;/a&gt;), our tag should reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scandinavian-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scandinavian-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scandinavian-literature&lt;/a&gt; for all modern literature from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and most medieval literature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Old Norse&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is trickier, but my gut feeling is that as this was really a separate tradition from that which eventually led to the literature in mainland Scandinavia, it merits a tag of its own. The study of Norse literature is often quite separate from the study of modern literature, and is closer to other traditions like that of Beowulf and the Nibelungenlied. Including it in the general tag would be akin to including classical Latin literature in the tag for Italian literature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/norse-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;norse-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;norse-literature&lt;/a&gt; for Icelandic sagas, the Eddas, runic poetry, and similar works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="315" LastActivityDate="2017-04-25T16:28:51.047" CommentCount="3" />

The process of translation can be pretty important for understanding the printed word. Translations typically aren't trying to create new literature, but are instead trying to preserve the meaning of existing language in new literature. That can be difficult when dealing with language barriers, but the decisions made, and the process itself, deeply affect the way we read books. I'd suggest a slight modification of this test: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question involves a specific text: does the question on translation involves an understanding of the text itself? If so, it's on topic here. If not, perhaps it should be asked on a language site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If not, is the question targeted towards thinking about books as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decision-making process for translators is complicated and convoluted at times.

However, any way I stack it up, it seems to me that it belongs somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with asking about analyzing academic articles with literary methods. And we should be specific here: it's a scientific article. In my view, this is a non-starter, simply being a question of using the wrong tools for the job. Scientific papers are just not written to have literary value and they should present no ambiguity. Any to be found in them is the result of poor authorship, nothing more. You might as well ask whether it's okay to analyse a list of ingredients on the side of a food can with literary techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving on to this exact instance, I'm not even sure that &quot;literary methods&quot; is what you're asking for here. You're asking &quot;why&quot; Turing put this ambiguity in his paper. There is no need to turn to literary methods to do this, and many answers have not. This is a question about the history of Turing's work and that is reflected in the answers it has received.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, let's consider whether we should consider it in terms how language impacts the scientific method. This is a very interesting field of study and one that's close to my own heart. However, academic treat this discipline very squarely as one of Sociology and Philosophy. There are of course links between social science, philosophy and literature, and authors like Derrida have contributed across all three fields. But most in the field belong to University Philosophy and Social Science departments and would agree that's where this subject belongs. There are already SE sites for those.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, what if we're looking at this as a matter of ambiguous language in a scientific paper, trying to get to the bottom of what an author actually indented? In that case I would argue you were better off consulting experts in the same academic field. There are multiple SE sites dealing with computer science, and one each for the physical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions like this are good questions.

Scientific papers are generally not primarily written to have literary value, but to convey an idea. Hidden meanings are mostly antithetic to this. However, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible for a scientific paper to have literary value, and questions about this are on-topic here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, however, does not settle the issue of your question. The main problem with your question is that you're begging a conclusion. You're clearly seeking to find a particular interpretation of a paper which wildly differs from what the paper means. (Yes, yes, I know, you're going to refute that one can objectively assign meaning to a text. But unless you're following a thoroughly solipsist philosophy, in which case what the particular figment of your mind that I am has to tell you may not matter, you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; assume that a text has objective meaning by the very act of reading this answer.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your original title was particularly problematic — “Why is the Turing Test really a test about gender?” is just as bad as “Why didn't Turing stop beating his wife”. A more reasonable title would be “Is the Turing Test really a test about gender?”. But that does not invalidate the question — it's still possible to answer, by saying “no, it isn't”. I had to think about it for a while, but I do conclude that the question is not off-topic, and it is answerable, so it should remain open.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do admit that I have a secondary motive in leaving the question open.

I'm afraid that this question can't be answered with any certainty unless we get more information about the quote.

Now I couldn't find any context for the quote either, after searching for it online, but I assume that an expert on Pablo Neruda's poetry would either recognise the quote and know where it came from or be able to locate it easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider if the question had instead been about Shakespeare's &quot;to be or not to be&quot; quote. If anyone had been unsure about the exact source or context of this line, somebody could easily have edited in a play/act/scene/line reference - the quote is easy to find by Googling.

If the former, we have the problem of the tag count - maximum 5. &lt;code&gt;author tag + title tag + comics + graphic novel&lt;/code&gt; makes 4, which leaves only 1 tag for &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plot&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;plot&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/a&gt; or whatever.

But @Gilles raised some valid points - when would we know to add the year from the start? What if more than one book with the same name gets published in a year? This would also exacerbate issues with the tag length. Also, what about a series? What date would we go by? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New users&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What happens when a new user comes and tries to ask a question about a book that there's no tag for? &lt;em&gt;Doggone it, I can't ask this because I can't create the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/walk-two-moons&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;walk-two-moons&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;walk-two-moons&lt;/a&gt; without 125 imaginary Internet points!

We should be trying to make the experience as pleasant as possible,  for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different names&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some books have more than one name they are referred to by. E.g. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone&lt;/em&gt; (yeah, I know that's included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/harry-potter&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;harry-potter&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;harry-potter&lt;/a&gt; - it's just an example), or a book that has a different name for different editions. What would we tag it?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; set up a synonym, but then how would we decide what the master tag is? Which name takes precedence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other languages&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say that I ask a question about a book that's only available in Hebrew. Good, that helps the variety problem. But uh-oh - how do I tag this? Tags don't support Hebrew characters, there's no official translation of the title in English, and it could be translated different ways. Transliteration? Hah. Transliteration is very subjective - just take a look at all of the different ways things are spelled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mi.yodeya.com&quot;&gt;Mi Yodeya&lt;/a&gt;. One word - שבת - can be transliterated many different ways: Shabbat,  Shabat, Shabbos, Sabbath... There are more. Point is, transliteration isn't going to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SE also has a tag limit that you run into eventually, although I highly doubt that we'll encounter that any time in the next five years even with title tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58" LastEditorUserId="17" LastEditDate="2017-06-14T11:29:11.637" LastActivityDate="2017-06-14T11:29:11.637" CommentCount="5" />

In fact, one could also search for &lt;code&gt;&quot;author&quot; &quot;title&quot;&lt;/code&gt; - is there no need for author tags as well then? I could make a case for abolishing author tags too, especially for comics, where the three authors (writer, penciller and inker, 4 if you count the colourist) all may have had the same contribution to the work (see &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New users, towards attracting which we are working, are unlikely to know the quirks of the SE search system. Encapsulating search strings in quotes (&lt;code&gt;&quot;title title&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) may be a known thing, but then how will we differentiate questions about a book from questions that merely mention it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And what if a book has a generic name like &lt;em&gt;Love&lt;/em&gt; (or my favourite, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)? Searching for &quot;love&quot; will yield (I'm sure of it) lots and lots of irrelevant results. Adding an author tag to the search? See above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two books of the same name published the same year? Please. Even if this ever happens, and both of those books find their way to this Stack (I bet 100 rep they won't), this is too much of an edge case to take into account when deciding title tags as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Following book tags is handier than following author tags&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Following is overrated anyways&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons for that, but most important of them is the ability to fine-tune the front page. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The number of works by one author could make following them uncomfortable&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following an author tag may be a drag for particularly prolific authors (see Stephen King), who have lots of books which may be in completely different genres. For instance, I like Mike Carey &lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt;, but don't care about his other works. Same goes for Holly Black, who wrote some issues of the new &lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt; - I liked it, but I couldn't care less about her young adult fantasy novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Too many tags to follow?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following is overrated, really. It may be useful on a site life SO, where a question is posted every 10 seconds, but here we get 4 questions per day - it should be easy to browse through all of them in some 10 minutes. Following too many tags may be a made up problem as well: how many tags do we have now? How many get added every day? With our growth rate, this issue is hardly a problem now and in the close future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of the limitations of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/filters&quot;&gt;SE question filter system&lt;/a&gt;, but I think the issue of using RSS or mail to follow tags is overrated. RSS subscriptions do have a limit on the number of tags, as does the site search. The solution - 2 RSS subscriptions! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following a lot of tags? Well, aren't you &lt;em&gt;interested&lt;/em&gt; in those works? Would you rather follow few tags but get loads of unrelated questions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The ability to hide books you don't like and to avoid spoilers&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if I want to follow an author one of whose books I have not yet read? I can unfollow the author, but that would still display the book on the front page - with spoilers and all that entails. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And what if I don't want to see questions about a certain book at all? &lt;strong&gt;Not using title tags will make the filtering of front page impossible&lt;/strong&gt;. Enter spoiler hellfest and those darn questions about &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lord of Flies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The limitations of the tagging system can be circumvented&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;With clever omissions, length of a tag is not a problem&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;E.g. we can drop some auxiliary words in the middle of a long title - it won't suffer as long as the users see something remotely similar when they begin to type the name. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the problem of adding/not adding &quot;The&quot; in front of a name - &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-lord-of-the-rings&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;the-lord-of-the-rings&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;the-lord-of-the-rings&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lord-of-the-rings&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;lord-of-the-rings&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;lord-of-the-rings&lt;/a&gt; - may be worse, because the tag system won't suggest the latter when one starts to type the former.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind&lt;/a&gt; I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kaze-no-tani-no-naushika&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;kaze-no-tani-no-naushika&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;kaze-no-tani-no-naushika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kaze-no-tani-no-nausicaa&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;kaze-no-tani-no-nausicaa&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;kaze-no-tani-no-nausicaa&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are sometimes used. When a user starts to type &lt;code&gt;naus&lt;/code&gt;, guess what they will see in suggested tags? :D &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/736/11&quot;&gt;Hamlet's feature request&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; yet have some new developments on the topic of tag length, so it's too early to close this page yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make up for awkward names with guidance in tag excerpts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what guidance is for, folks! All problems, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hpmor&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hpmor&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hpmor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/love-2017&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;love-2017&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;love-2017&lt;/a&gt; will be solved with an appropriate guidance. If the askers can't follow the guidance, a &quot;good&quot; tag name will not help as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of tags for books of the same name would look like &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Use this tag for the book by X written in Y&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Use this tag for the book by M written in N&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which clearly indicated the difference between the two books. The important part would be to set this rule straight from the beginning, and adhere to it in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I still think this criterion is a nitpick, as, to the best of my knowledge, we still haven't received 2 questions about books with the same name - maybe we could admit that &lt;strong&gt;books with the same name are not that common to make a fuss over it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to choose the name of a tag?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simple - follow your best judgment. If the title has alternative British and American spellings, make them synonyms, and use whatever is the original one. If the title is translated - use an official translation, and set up synonyms for other translations and the original name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Too long? Clever abbreviations, and common sense. E.g. for a question about &lt;em&gt;The Secret Lost Diary of Admiral Richard E. Byrd and The Phantom of the Poles&lt;/em&gt;, my instinct tell me to go for &lt;code&gt;[the-secret-lost-diary]&lt;/code&gt;, which makes sense and is probably what a new user would begin to type when asking a question about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For any kind of misunderstanding, there is always &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1037/the-reading-room&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; and meta, where think tanks can be gathered and tag names decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Creating tags for new works and maintaining them is what we (the community) are there for&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A new user can't find a tag for their work and leaves in frustration? Good riddance! A new user uses a generic tag and leaves a comment asking someone to create needed tags? That's the spirit!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this may be a nice litmus test for new users, as an indicator of their will to ask a question here.

Subjects like boats, finance, economies, medieval history, modern technology, and geography get used in those games. So, people started asking us directly about &lt;em&gt;those topics:&lt;/em&gt; they'd ask us about &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/12911/middle-age-transportation-by-river-questions&quot;&gt;real-life medieval boating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/14680/which-technologies-commodities-were-available-during-the-30s-in-the-usa&quot;&gt;the 1930's USA economy&lt;/a&gt; or other stuff which frankly had nothing to do with any of our expertise in role-playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something seemed wrong about that. We weren't meant to be &lt;em&gt;Anything At All Stack Exchange.&lt;/em&gt; There were sites like History.SE for questions like that boating one. We weren't sure where to draw the line until 2012, and I'll get to the line we drew in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Literature has some risk for that too: &amp;ldquo;this thing showed up in a book, so I'll ask about it on literature&amp;rdquo; potentially enters domains requiring expertise totally unrelated to literature expertise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/1051/was-mark-twain-actually-almost-a-millionaire-twice-over-before-he-became-famous&quot;&gt;Was Mark Twain actually almost a millionaire twice over, before he became famous?&lt;/a&gt; was an early borderline question that made me concerned Literature might eventually experience this very phenomenon (though that question seemed to be received OK and may not itself be representative of this issue).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's where RPG.SE drew the line: we decided to only accept questions that were materially related to RPG expertise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;Our on topic help&lt;/a&gt; now sports the following passage:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Questions about a general real-world topic such as history, geography or economics, whilst relevant to RPGs, may be off topic if they are not RPG-centric (or better belong on another Stack Exchange site, such as History). A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Would an RPG expert give me a better/different/more specific answer to this question than a Historian, Geographer, etc?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If yes, then feel free to ask it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means &amp;ldquo;how does the F-22 fighter jet work?&amp;rdquo; is off topic and should be asked on &lt;em&gt;Aviation SE&lt;/em&gt; instead, but &amp;ldquo;how can I model the F-22 for this pilot character in Dresden Files RPG?&amp;rdquo; is on topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We adopted this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/a/14/2698&quot;&gt;from Game Dev Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, which has a very similar passage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;their own on topic help&lt;/a&gt; to handle their own issue of non-game-related art, music, and programming questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know where you'd draw the line on Literature Stack Exchange, though, and it might take a different formula instead.

However, this particular piece of trivia is almost the &lt;em&gt;main point&lt;/em&gt; of that XKCD comic. The joke is that &quot;died in a car accident&quot; or &quot;died in a skydiving accident&quot; are commonly-heard phrases whereas (almost) nobody ever says &quot;die in a blogging accident&quot; or &quot;die in a haberdashery accident&quot;. Given that a couple of people actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; use the least popular of the phrases on the chart, it's interesting to ask who.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of judging questions' on-topic-ness for this site by how &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; they are, as I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2207/what-were-the-inspirations-for-the-forsakens-names/2209#comment4171_2207&quot;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/1037?m=38277882#38277882&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, but I think this particular question would be OK even if we were applying such stringent criteria. So the answer to this one is MU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a question for literature experts?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it's not a literary analysis question - that's for sure. But we've &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/283/17&quot;&gt;already established&lt;/a&gt; that this site isn't just for literary analysis questions. What you need to answer this question is &lt;em&gt;internet research skills&lt;/em&gt; - which is exactly what you need to answer many other questions here which nobody would dispute are about literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/766/17&quot;&gt;doppelgreener's answer&lt;/a&gt;, while it makes some very good general points which we might want to consider at some later stage, doesn't really apply to this particular question. This isn't a question for historians or geologists or anyone else; it's a question to which our site's 'experts' are at least as well-suited as any other's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why, then, did I vote to close this question myself at first? Well, I think - and I suspect others feel similarly - it was a combination of the fact that it's about a borderline on-topic work and the fact that it doesn't seem literary. Put together &quot;&lt;strong&gt;ugh, XKCD, that's not proper literature&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;ugh, hunting for Google results, that's not literary&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; (both forms of literature snobbery) and they're enough to extract a semi-unwilling close vote even if neither on its own would have been.

We can confine it to books. Or we can confine it to literary analysis. That question isn't about a book and it isn't about literary analysis, so I don't really see how it is on-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I pointed out that he was wrong about this, because we have plenty of questions not about books &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; plenty of questions not about literary analysis, I began to realise what the problem is: this question is in the intersection of two regions of controversy and borderline on-topic-ness, which makes people more willing to VTC it than if it had been in just one of them. But:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR: if a question is in two categories which are &lt;em&gt;only just&lt;/em&gt; on-topic, then it too should be on-topic.

I would say that this argument reveals a fundamental disconnect about the purpose of this site, as well as what literature should be about. To put it mildly, whether a question is &quot;practical&quot; is a terrible way to evaluate questions on a site about literature. The purpose of literature, and art in general, isn't &quot;practical&quot; in nature. If the only argument in favor of story-id questions is that they are practical, then they have no place on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's try a different yardstick for measuring whether a question is a good question: does the question increase one's understanding or appreciation of literature? Obviously, this is in many ways a subjective judgement. But I would argue that no matter what way you look at it, story-id questions do not increase anyone's understanding or appreciation of literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the structure of a typical story-id question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Question: I can't remember the following story.

That [story x] exists, and that it contains a, b, and c. That's it! Any other question on the site, you would learn something about literature: an explanation for a plot point, an explanation of the author's intent in a particular passage, etc. But with story-id questions, you can't learn anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is why I feel so strongly that all story-id questions should be closed as off-topic. They don't help this site become a resource to learn more about literature, because there is nothing to learn from story-id questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-06-28T01:56:44.573" LastActivityDate="2017-06-28T01:56:44.573" CommentCount="12" />

Please do NOT use this tag to ask for literature recommendations - it is meant to find stories you have forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A list of details one should add to their question includes, but is not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A meaningful title&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The title, ideally, should mention the key points that would make the people who see the title and have read the story identify it immediately, or make the people who have not read the story become interested in it. Because of that, titles like &lt;code&gt;Looking for a short story I read as a kid&lt;/code&gt; are not helpful at all. A title like &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2515/11&quot;&gt;Overpopulated world, where volunteers are being taken to be converted to food&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, seems to have at least some connotations, so it has attracted comments and an answer with guesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The age of the story&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was it an old crumbling book or a fresh one?

This is not an attempt to gather the best of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; answers from 2017 Q1, but rather a collection of my own posts that I'm most pleased with. I'm sure others have written even better answers than these.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few different types of answer on this site: those based on &lt;strong&gt;online research&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. finding interviews, reviews, any other relevant material to be quoted); those based on &lt;strong&gt;careful reading&lt;/strong&gt; (simply taking the text of a story and examining it carefully, pulling out quotes to support one's conclusions); and those based on &lt;strong&gt;subject knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; (which don't necessarily need to be supported by any kind of quotes, but simply by a deep knowledge and expertise on the material of the story).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Online research is, in my view, the least interesting of these. Subject knowledge is of course a great thing to use on any SE, and careful reading is a literary skill which can be honed to great effect, but Googling up some quotes is a skill which isn't really very literary. I don't say this to be snobbish - Googling &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a skill, and a useful one, and a lot of my own answers are based on online research, especially from my early days here when I was still too influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;SFF&lt;/a&gt; - but to justify my choices in this post. I've mostly ignored online-research answers when hunting for favourites here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've gone through &lt;strong&gt;my own answers from 2017 Q1&lt;/strong&gt; to pick out the ones I'm most proud of.

Reading order is &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/20/17&quot;&gt;definitely on-topic&lt;/a&gt;, and this particular case is one where the answer isn't obvious: &lt;em&gt;New Spring&lt;/em&gt; comes first in in-universe chronology (a prequel), but it's in the middle in terms of out-of-universe chronology, and involves concepts and characters not introduced in the main series until several books in. A good answer would require knowing which concepts and characters are introduced when throughout the series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said ... it's been deleted by the Community bot &lt;strong&gt;four times&lt;/strong&gt; now, and undeleted each time by Mithrandir (sometimes helped by me and/or Gallifreyan).

Both of those groups of users may include people who dislike all reading-order questions, and who found this particular question through meta which they otherwise wouldn't have seen. There are a remarkably high number of votes (7 up, 9 down) on the question; 16 people voting is unusual for any non-HNQ on this site, and I suspect not all of those 16 are particularly active users here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of all this is not to sling mud - everyone is entitled to their vote, active user or no - but to make the case that &lt;strong&gt;if it were re-asked today, the question would probably be received better.&lt;/strong&gt; Normally I'm hot against people re-asking poorly received questions instead of simply editing to improve them, but if my hypothesis is correct that most of the downvoters aren't Lit regulars, then &lt;strong&gt;editing this question is unlikely to change its vote count by much.&lt;/strong&gt; So in this particular case (without wanting to set any kind of precedent), I think it would be acceptable to leave the question deleted and re-ask an improved version of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to improve it? Well, some explanation of why it's a decent question, why the answer isn't obvious, would make a good start. Something like the first paragraph of this very meta answer, for example. I'd say we should give @Riker himself the first chance to post an improved version, but it wouldn't be inappropriate for someone else to do so instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2017-07-01T16:49:56.677" CommentCount="8" />

Especially when instead of having a specific tag to mark these questions, they could just be marked by &lt;em&gt;the absence of any other language tag&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides, are we likely to have any users who are experts in English literature as a whole and will want to search that tag?

Tagging should be simple, genre tags are anything but.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the fact that we already have a lot of tags. Questions are tagged with title tags, author tags, and language tags. Adding a genre tag puts us perilously close to the five tag limit. If we add genre tags, we should remove title tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/456/how-do-we-feel-about-genre-based-tags&quot;&gt;It's come to my attention that the previous consensus is also in favor of avoiding genre tags&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Part 2: for questions about a specific genre, we should have a generic &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/genre&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;genre&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt; tag&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there's a question about the Science Fiction genre, or about the Children's Literature genre, then they should be tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/genre&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;genre&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/science-fiction&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;science-fiction&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;science-fiction&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/childrens-literature&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;childrens-literature&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;childrens-literature&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is simple. Consider the question &quot;Should the Wheel of Time series be classified as Science Fiction or Fantasy?&quot; If we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/science-fiction&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;science-fiction&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;science-fiction&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fantasy&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;fantasy&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; tag, the logical decision would be to tag that question with both tags. Since the question would presumably have an author and title tag as well, we would be approaching four tags. Which isn't that bad for that question, but I could imagine questions that compare three or four different genres causing problems. Using just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/genre&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;genre&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt; tag seems a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Part 3: Again, for questions about a specific genre, we should have a generic genre tag&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But what if someone has a question about a genre, not about a book in a genre or classifying a book into a genre... What if I wanted to know about a trope within a certain genre? Does it still make sense to use the generic &quot;genre&quot; tag?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I gave a practical reason in part 2. Here's the equally practical but more literary reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reasoning underlying all of my objections to genre-based tags is the understanding that genres are not clearly defined, objective categories. Exactly like the concept of literature, the concept of genre is marketing and politics. Some interesting examples of the way marketing and politics create genre:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genre of solarpunk was created before there were any stories to label as solarpunk (thank you BESW for telling me about Solarpunk). Which was the point: creating the genre of solarpunk, and writing the equivalent of a mission statement describing why solarpunk was necessary, inspired people to start creating solarpunk books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Potter was originally marketed as children's literature. That changed in part because adults also enjoyed reading Harry Potter, and the adults didn't like having something they enjoyed being labeled as for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Genre is fluid. Genre is constantly making exceptions to any definition you give it. Genre is the exact opposite of what a tag is supposed to be--an easily definable concept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how a question about a trope should be tagged. First of all, I'm not even sure if we should encourage questions about tropes; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indelicates.com/trope/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;it might not be the best concept for studying literature&lt;/a&gt;. But I do know that individual genres are not objectively definable, and therefore I would question the notion that a genre can be objectively associated with a trope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Part 4: What is a genre?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To be fair, I don't really have a clear definition of what a &quot;genre&quot; is. But it seems odd to me to have a genre defined purely in terms of the target audience, rather than in terms of what the stories are actually about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don't necessarily need to agree on an exact definition of genre. But when we see a category of books defined by marketing and politics, that's a good sign that we're talking about genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had to give a specific definition of genre, I would give a definition along the lines of the one BESW gave in a comment to this answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Functionally speaking, genre is usually shorthand for &quot;people who like X will also like Y.&quot; It's most often applied by marketers and distributors, rather than authors or analysts, in order to funnel likely audiences toward the work. Genre labels also are not exclusive; you can (and should) have a decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-07-11T13:56:53.403" LastActivityDate="2017-07-11T13:56:53.403" CommentCount="6" />

So answers on Mythology need to, among other things, break down the different versions of the myth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to oral literature, things are a little bit different. You can ask about &quot;motifs&quot; which are essentially &quot;tale types&quot;: a way of categorizing all of the different versions of a story floating around in oral tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Myth is not a tag we should use on this site because it really is a genre. For example, when it comes to something like Norse mythology, the term &quot;Norse mythology&quot; is unclear. Are you talking about the Christianized version of Norse mythology recorded in the prose and poetic eddas? Are you talking about the oral tradition that we have no real record of? Or are you talking about modern adaptations of Norse mythology?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that defines questions on Literature is that people usually read the books they ask questions about. I think this leads to very good questions. A broad concept such as &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;[culture] mythology&quot; encourages people to ask broad questions, which then need to be answered with a frame challenge. If we can, we should guide people in the direction of working out the frame challenge aspect of their question themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Not having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/myths&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;myths&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt; tag is a very good way to get people to think about the fact that there are multiple versions of myths, and to get people to state whether they are asking a comparison question or a question about a specific version.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have a question about Norse Mythology. You try to tag it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/norse-mythology&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;norse-mythology&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;norse-mythology&lt;/a&gt;, but you realize that the tag refers to Gaiman's adaptation. (Or we rename &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/norse-mythology&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;norse-mythology&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;norse-mythology&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gaiman-norse-mythology&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;gaiman-norse-mythology&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;gaiman-norse-mythology&lt;/a&gt; to make this clearer). So then you're trying to figure out what tags to you. It might take a bit of thinking, but you should eventually have to decide whether you want to ask about the Prose/Poetic Edda, Gaiman's adaptation, both, or neither. And your question will be improved because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Myth is not an easily definable topic; like a genre, it shouldn't get it's own tag.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An answer to this question referenced the fact that a Stack Exchange exists about the topic to support the fact that myth is a field and that it should get its own tag. But if you look at the mythology meta, you'll see that they had, and still have, a very hard time defining what mythology actually is. We already decided that we shouldn't have genre tags because genre is too hard to define. The same should go for the myth tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-08-03T21:06:12.423" LastActivityDate="2017-08-03T21:06:12.423" CommentCount="2" />

This question &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about a Sherlock Holmes story, just not one written by Arthur Conan Doyle; thus I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sherlock-holmes&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;sherlock-holmes&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;sherlock-holmes&lt;/a&gt; tag but not &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arthur-conan-doyle&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;arthur-conan-doyle&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;arthur-conan-doyle&lt;/a&gt; (which led to the odd fact of the former tag having more questions than the latter). There are a couple of ways to justify this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The story being asked about is in some sense &lt;strong&gt;part of the same series&lt;/strong&gt;, thus gets the title tag, but &lt;strong&gt;not by the same author&lt;/strong&gt;, thus  doesn't get the author tag.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People interested in Sherlock Holmes stories may also be interested in non-Doylian ones, so it makes sense for them to find a list of all questions about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Holmes story by a simple tag search. If they're purists and only want to look at questions about the original Doyle stories, that list can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be found by a simple tag search, just with two tags instead of one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the same reason, I would say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/1966/17&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; should have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/harry-potter&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;harry-potter&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;harry-potter&lt;/a&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question is about a story which is &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; another story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the situation with the Canterbury Tales question you mentioned, and it's a little harder to deal with. There are (at least) two ways of looking at this, with different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we want to tag questions according to what the story is about?&lt;/strong&gt; The answer to this seems to be no, judging from our current tagging system. We're not using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/world-war-two&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;world-war-two&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;world-war-two&lt;/a&gt; tag for questions about WWII literature, or an &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animals&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;animals&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; tag for questions on books about animals, so why should we use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/geoffrey-chaucer&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;geoffrey-chaucer&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;geoffrey-chaucer&lt;/a&gt; tag for asking about a story &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; Chaucer, even if that tag does already exist in the system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this question relevant to Chaucer experts?&lt;/strong&gt; I'd say the answer to this is yes. Someone who knows a lot about the real Chaucer and his works might also know a lot about portrayals of Chaucer in fiction, or at least be interested in such stories. Imagine if the question was about a non-fiction biography of Chaucer; I doubt there'd be any objections to putting the Chaucer tag on it in that case. And fiction or non-fiction doesn't make a difference to the question's Chauceriness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2017-07-12T11:16:15.370" CommentCount="2" />

If Asimov ever posed on a throne of his own publications, that's a statement about his prolific output and was probably a publicity stunt organized by his publisher.

  <row Id="808" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="806" CreationDate="2017-07-19T06:37:18.297" Score="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;I originally left a comment on this question, but upon reflection I realize that my thoughts about this are too complicated to sum up in a comment. I deleted my comment; there was no foul play. (Nor was there reason to suspect foul play in my mind, but that is a point for another day).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of authors who are racist, or sexist, or bigoted, or prejudiced, or anti-Semitic. In this respect, authors aren't that different from normal people; the difference is that authors write their thoughts down and publish them, where they are discussed in places like this website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, JKR is probably the last author people would accuse of racism, but &quot;Cho Chang&quot; is literally a made up name. Pretty much the only thing Isaac Asimov did at science fiction conventions was harass woman, but for some reason he has a reputation for being &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;feminist&quot;. (This shows in Asimov's writing: his female characters are either nonexistent or stereotypes). Tolkien's &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; is racist as well, to the point where he's using the exact same language used to justify slavery and genocide. I bring up these particular authors because they are popular and because their prejudices are often justified or swept under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a site about Literature, it's important to understand the difference between the following two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reading and studying an author's words.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Endorsing an author's words.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to assume good faith. This is the internet, the people who participate on this site come from a wide range of backgrounds and have a wide range of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's important to understand that there is no tension between enjoying an author's work while criticizing aspects of said author's work or personal beliefs. I personally do not agree Ezra Pound's anti-Semitism, but that does not contradict the fact that Ezra Pound has written some beautiful works of literature (here's a sample: &quot;The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough.&quot;). It's possible for people to enjoy reading Pound while also acknowledging and disagreeing with his political views. It's also possible, and in fact desirable, to read Pound with the understanding that Pound's anti-Semitism is not isolated to his private life, but influences his writings as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My perspective on the advertisement is that a quote from an author other than Ezra Pound should have been used. My reasoning for this is twofold. First of all, the advertisement consists of a quote, not a discussion of a quote, which could be seen as endorsement. Second, since this is a community promotion advertisement, authors should be chosen that represent the entire community. And I think this question perhaps makes clear that this particular advertisement might not represent the community. (Also, there are probably more insightful and interesting quotes we could have used!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think my perspective on this would be much different if this had been, for example, a member of this community expressing admiration of Pound's poem &quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot;. But given the specifics of this situation, I agree, this wasn't a good choice for a community promotion advertisement. There should be more thought about the message our promotional materials sends. I think this is a good learning opportunity for our community. So I'm glad this discussion was started on meta. And I think deleting this discussion would deprive this community of a valuable learning opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-07-19T23:43:31.303" LastActivityDate="2017-07-19T23:43:31.303" CommentCount="6" />

A lot of traffic is coming from &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/site-analytics/traffic-sources&quot;&gt;stackoverflow.com&lt;/a&gt; (you need 5k rep to see that link), presumably from things like HNQ, but we've got some not insignificant hits from Google as well. Facebook also has apparently referred users to here 240 times - thanks, I guess, to whoever linked us on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not seeing stuff from the Twitter account on the 2k tools, or from the Tumblr account, but the Twitter account has done some good things (such as attracting authors to here).

Now, for some other things...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we've done a good job in educating the community here on certain things. For instance, @Hamlet has been working hard to make sure that we're educated on things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/608/58&quot;&gt;authorial intent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/2783/58&quot;&gt;close reading&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Shout out to @Hamlet for your work in educating us!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've been working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/88/58&quot;&gt;biases in Literature&lt;/a&gt; - specifically, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/596/58&quot;&gt;topic challenges&lt;/a&gt; help with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've gotten some &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/258/peter?tab=profile&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; to join the site and participate, which is very good. We've got some very knowledgeable users. I think we could use some more, but for existing for half a year, we're not doing to badly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site scope has changed pretty drastically for some people since private beta. The site originally seemed as though it was going to be for minutia about works of Literature, much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Scifi.SE&lt;/a&gt; - focused on canon and 'word of god' answers. While these typed of &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt; about minutia are still on topic (and well received, I hope), the 'word of god' answers are now expected to show some basis for the conclusion in the text of the work itself.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is good, because Lit is hoping to be considered a more serious and academic site than SFF... at least that I can tell, and it's doing a fairly good job that IMO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal vision for the site is for us to accept all types of questions - 'trivia' questions about works, analysis questions, Story-IDs, and others - and accept them, well, and &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; them well. I'm seeing a tilt towards analysis questions at the moment, which is perfectly fine - the other questions will come in time, and analysis questions are generally higher quality. I hope that someday we'll have a &lt;code&gt;cite&lt;/code&gt; button next to share ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to say that after half a year, I've had to do almost nothing that really requires the diamond.

Note that Lit is a young enough site not to have this problem: adding the tag to as many questions as need it is a feasible endeavour, if we decide that this tag is worthwhile, so I can't see it going the same way as SFF's tag further down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-08-20T21:56:34.973" LastActivityDate="2017-08-20T21:56:34.973" Title="Do we want a [plot-explanation] tag?"

  <row Id="825" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="821" CreationDate="2017-08-03T21:29:51.530" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;Here are the reasons why I think that tags such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/meaning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;meaning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt;, and the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plot-explanation&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;plot-explanation&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;plot-explanation&lt;/a&gt; aren't really worth having around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags are supposed to help people find questions that they can answer. These tags don't do that. There isn't such a thing as being an expert in meaning, or being knowledgeable about plot-explanations. Answering a plot-explanation question can involve anything from close reading to critical theory to explaining a basic grammatical question. Contrast that to a tag such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-canterbury-tales&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;the-canterbury-tales&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;the-canterbury-tales&lt;/a&gt;, where questions with that tag, more likely than not, will require knowledge of &lt;em&gt;The Canterbury Tales&lt;/em&gt; to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tags are broad, unintuitive, and unspecific. For example, meaning can mean anything from &quot;What does word x in this story mean?&quot; to &quot;what is the meaning of character y's obsession with idea z?&quot; Symbolism: does that only refer to questions about objects in stories (e.g. what does the white dress symbolize)? Or does symbolism refer to, to quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/661/111&quot;&gt;a meta post on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Any time there is something that represents more than its literal meaning&quot;? In that case, can I use the symbolism tag for plot-explanation questions, e.g. what does the ending symbolize? And plot explanation: plot can refer to stages of a story, e.g. ending or beginning, it can refer to specific actions characters take, it can refer to the order of events in a story... you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these tags are used inconsistently, which probably is due to them being broad and unspecific. To use some my questions as an example (simply because they're easy for me to find), I've asked many questions that could be tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/meaning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;meaning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt;. But while people have retagged my questions on many occasions, no one has bothered to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/meaning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;meaning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; tags, perhaps because people don't have a clear definition to use when deciding whether the tags are appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2988/what-is-a-cristopher&quot;&gt;What is a &amp;quot;Cristopher&amp;quot;?&lt;/a&gt; could very easily be a symbolism question--it's about an object--but no one retagged the question, despite the question getting a relative amount of attention. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2976/mathematics-or-gibberish-understanding-a-description-of-an-alien-message-in-his&quot;&gt;Mathematics or gibberish? Understanding a description of an alien message in His Master&amp;#39;s Voice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2639/why-is-the-future-a-safe-sterile-laboratory&quot;&gt;Why is the future &amp;quot;a safe, sterile laboratory&amp;quot;?&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2989/how-much-french-does-madame-eglentyne-know&quot;&gt;How much French does Madame Eglentyne know?&lt;/a&gt; are all questions about the meaning of a specific passage that received a fair bit of attention, but again, no one felt confident enough to retag the questions. I could go on and compile a whole list; these are just a few of the questions on my profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, looking through the symbolism tag, I see a lot of questions that could also be tagged with the meaning tag. Just on the first page of the tag, I already found &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/3143/does-the-poem-in-just-e-e-cummings-allude-to-innocents-being-led-astray-by&quot;&gt;Does the poem &amp;#39;In Just&amp;#39; (e. e. cummings) allude to innocents being led astray by the devil?&lt;/a&gt;, which could also use the meaning tag. And from the meaning tag: &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2698/in-the-song-ja-is-playing-jazz-%d0%94%d0%b6%d0%b0-%d0%b8%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b5%d1%82-%d0%b4%d0%b6%d0%b0%d0%b7-who-is-ja&quot;&gt;In the song &amp;quot;Ja is Playing Jazz&amp;quot; (Джа играет джаз), who is Ja?&lt;/a&gt; could very easily be reworded to &quot;what does ja symbolize&quot;.

In fact, I've answered my own questions too. For example, I recently asked several questions about &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/3047/why-wasnt-obrien-considered-a-thought-criminal&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; about why O'Brien wasn't a thought criminal for admitting to the Party's malice and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/3046/why-does-obrien-claim-that-the-party-didnt-believe-in-solipsism&quot;&gt;another question&lt;/a&gt; about why O'Brien claimed that the party didn't believe in solipsism. I thought about the questions more after I posted them and finally realized what the answer was, so I posted them as self-answers. They're not perfect answers by any stretch of the imagination, but both of them got upvotes and have positive scores, which seems to imply that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; found them useful, so obviously they were worth posting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of this is also a cultural thing that's unique to each site. For example, for whatever reason on Stack Overflow self-answers tend to be judged more harshly than other questions, which I &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; disagree with because if someone's supplying useful information then we shouldn't discourage that. Self-answers and their accompanying questions should be assessed exactly how you judge other questions and answers - is the question clear, useful, and reflecting research effort? Is the answer useful, clearly written, and presenting valid information and justification? (I'm being careful about how I phrase the last one - &quot;correct&quot; can be a little more ambiguous in controversial cases, but an answer that I disagree with but still presents correct information and valid reasons to agree with their views can still deserve upvotes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Point being that I think we should encourage people to share information here, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; information that's difficult or impossible to find elsewhere. The main point of Stack Exchange is to serve as a repository of knowledge and to enable people to share information with each other, so if you have useful information to share with the community, by all means please share it so that it can be documented here for the benefit of current and future readers. So, if anything, I think that Q&amp;amp;A about obscure works could be very useful to someone who was looking for more information on those works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to the user who quit over your other self-answer, I wouldn't worry about that. I agree with @Hamlet here - it seems like a really petty reason for the user in question to quit to me. Obviously, the fact that other people upvoted the Q&amp;amp;A you link to indicates that other members of the community disagree with him about the answer being low quality. (Incidentally, I upvoted both the question and answer too because I think that it's useful information; in fact, I wondered the exact same thing when I initially read &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt; in school).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO, part of participating in Stack Exchange is that you have to be willing for other people to disagree with you without being outraged or taking it personally, so if the user in question couldn't do that they're not necessarily a good fit for the community in the first place. Because, guess what? No one is right 100% of the time, and there will always be people who disagree with you. Besides, if you think about it, the fact that someone disagreed with you online is a very first-world problem that's hardly catastrophic in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="793" LastActivityDate="2017-08-11T15:15:43.497" CommentCount="1" />

  <row Id="838" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="837" CreationDate="2017-08-13T16:22:15.980" Score="7" Body="&lt;p&gt;I applaud your enthusiasm, and agree that as many questions as possible should have good answers, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ... it's easier than you might think to lose track of quality in pursuit of quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please don't be too discouraged by the following answer. It's great that you're keen to help improve the site,  and solving unanswered questions is a very worthy goal, but we need to be very careful about how we go about organising such an effort, to avoid making the problem even worse than it is already.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;Back in private beta, there was a huge surge of new questions and answers in the very first few days. Many of the answers provided back then were very low-effort (e.g. comprising not much more than a quote from Wikipedia or Shmoop) and yet still stand to this day with far more upvotes than they deserve. We've got much (&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;) better at writing high-quality answers and voting down low-quality ones - partly due to shifts in the userbase, partly due to existing users learning and improving - but there's still a danger that seeking an answer just for the sake of having &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; answer might distract us from ensuring it's a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can't answer it well, don't answer it at all.&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds a bit too strong, but really, the last thing we need is more bad answers knocking around. It's much better to spend a few hours writing up a really good answer to one question than to spend the same time posting mediocre answers to ten unanswered questions. None of us can answer everything, so let's try to focus on what we can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember to downvote as well as upvote.&lt;/strong&gt; It's important to mark good answers by upvoting them, yes ... but it's equally important, nay, &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; important, to mark bad ones by downvoting them. People are very unlikely to spend rep downvoting good answers, but they can and &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; upvote bad answers, and wanting to reduce the number of questions marked as Unanswered just provides extra motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't focus too much on statistics.&lt;/strong&gt; Answer quality can't be judged objectively by figures, least of all on a site like this. Our main objective should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be to reduce the percentage of unanswered questions, because &lt;em&gt;we could achieve that by posting and upvoting bad answers&lt;/em&gt;. I know that's not at all what you're advocating, but if you make &quot;getting questions answered&quot; the primary objective, people &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; start doing that, just for the buzz of seeing those numbers decrease. Imagine this situation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Here's a question which I'm not competent to answer perfectly, with an existing zero-score answer which isn't all that great. Should I leave it alone in the hope that someone will eventually answer it better, or should I upvote the answer because YAY, another post knocked off the Unanswered list?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We know what &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be done here. But we also know what would feel more satisfying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patience, my young padawan.&lt;/strong&gt; This is what I always say to people too obsessed with reputation or badges, and really, much of the same reasoning applies here. Getting rep shouldn't be a goal in itself; focus on providing good content, and the rep will flow in anyway. Same here. The numbers shouldn't be our priority; focus on providing good content and they'll sort themselves out automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that &lt;strong&gt;unanswered questions are easy to find&lt;/strong&gt;. An expert in Author McPoetface can join the site, look for unanswered &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/author-mcpoetface&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;author-mcpoetface&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;author-mcpoetface&lt;/a&gt; questions, and put their knowledge to good use in answering them. If they already have upvoted subpar answers, then a) they won't appear on the unanswered list, and b) experts might be put off from providing better ones. &lt;strong&gt;A question poorly answered is actually &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; for the site than one not answered at all&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes it even more important for us not to post answers just for the sake of posting answers, but focus on quality.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Here's how this &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe all of the above was a bit dampening to your spirits and enthusiasm. Sorry about that, but it did have to be said. Here's a (true!) story of how what you propose can work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Earlier today I was browsing through the unanswered &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/poetry&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;poetry&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; questions, looking for something to answer, when I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2509/17&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; about the poem &quot;A German Requiem&quot;. Over the next several hours, I read the poem many times trying to understand what it was all about, read existing analysis and critique of it online to improve my understanding, looked at all the three questions about it on the site so far and the single existing answer to one of them, and gradually built up my experience until I was ready to attempt an answer. I was lucky enough to have stumbled across a poem with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; unanswered questions about it, so I managed to knock two off the list. The majority of my SE time today has gone on researching and writing those two answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; people are willing to put that kind of effort into answering old unanswered questions, then maybe this can work. But the goal should always be to provide answers we can be really proud of, not to make the numbers go down. If we start worrying too much about numbers, quality could suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2017-08-13T16:22:15.980" CommentCount="8" />

Don't just say &quot;this is the book you're looking for&quot;; show how each of those data points (or as many as you can) match the book you've found. Ideally you could do this using citations, e.g. quote and link to an online description of the story with the relevant parts highlighted, but using just your own memory of the story is fine too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that &lt;strong&gt;it allows people other than the OP to quickly judge the answer.&lt;/strong&gt; The OP will probably (though not necessarily!) recognise the name or title of the story as soon as they see it again, so for them it might be enough to say &quot;this is the book you're looking for&quot; and they'll go &quot;aha, so it is&quot;. But we're trying to build a repository of useful knowledge for everyone, and it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/14/17&quot;&gt;an established fact&lt;/a&gt; that story-ID posts are useful to people other than the OP, so let's try to ensure that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; can judge the answer's correctness as soon as they see it, without having to look up the book online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show your working - explain how you found the answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might be hard to do if you simply recognised the story by yourself, although even then you could say &quot;it was &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; detail that jogged my memory, and then all the rest fell into place&quot; (might be interesting to see which features of a story are the most memorable or distinctive). But many story-ID questions are answered by searching the internet, and choosing the right search terms is a skill - share it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that &lt;strong&gt;it allows people to learn more than just the answer to one question.&lt;/strong&gt; It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_a_man_a_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_day;_teach_a_man_to_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_lifetime&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;teaching a man to fish&lt;/a&gt; - by showing people &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to answer as well as just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the answer is, you're teaching them (the silent readers as well as the OP) the skill of finding an unidentified story, which may enable them to find it themselves next time. Again, this is about story-ID answers having lasting value rather than just helping one person on one day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/1985/17&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;, I explained exactly which search terms I used to find the story, and quoted Wikipedia's description of it with the bits mentioned in the question highlighted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/revisions/3322/1&quot;&gt;This answer&lt;/a&gt; needed improvement: it gave the right story, but without verifying agreement with the question, or even linking to an online summary, and without any detail of how the answerer found it.

The answer is helpful to someone looking for a broad explanation, but given that the question is about a specific quote, the answer isn't actually helpful to anyone with the actual question that the OP asked!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you write an answer,  take a minute to check that you've actually answered the question.  If you find that you've written an answer to a completely different question,  there is nothing stopping you from asking a new question and writing a self answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Back up all your claims&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this site, it is critical that you back up all of your claims with evidence, arguments, or experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of Stack Exchange sites, including this one, is to serve as a repository of knowledge, not merely a repository of discussion or opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a student writing a paper, or someone doing research... in other words, someone who is likely to find our questions through Google, which is the source of most of our traffic. Let's say you Google a question about Literature, and a similar question from this site is the first result. You click on the question, hoping that the answers will be helpful for your research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you find is that while the answers make many claims, they provide nothing to back their claims up. Since this is the internet, anyone can make up even the most basic of facts. Since you're doing research and want information that is true, and since you have no way of knowing whether the claims made by the answers are, in fact, true (you are just starting out on your research), you leave the site in disgust and keep using Google. This is an outcome we want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that the answers backed up their claims using quotes, citations, arguments, or experience. All of these things make it very easy to verify whether the claims are correct. For example, with a citation or a quote, it's easy to tell whether the citation is real and reputable. Researchers arriving from Google will be able to be confident that our answers will be correct. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of this example is that it's not enough to be correct; answers must also be persuasive. This means backing claims up with quotes, citations, arguments, or experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Backing claims up is important in every Stack Exchange site, but it is particular important on a subjective site like this one. We frequently get questions where there are multiple correct answers, ie legitimate arguments can be made for answers that have different conclusions. To avoid geting into counterprductive debates, we need answers to give arguments, not unsupported claims. Doing so transforms pointless fights (Shakespeare was a pseudonym! No you're wrong!) into reasoned debates (using this evidence, I conclude... that's interesting, but have you considered...). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Good answers explain why and how&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare the following two answers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; According to Pofessor So and So, thing x in poem y represents z.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Pofessor So and So believes that thing x in poem y represents z.

In short, people with impaired vision use programs called screen readers to be able to work with computers.

Here is my reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags are supposed to help people find questions that they can answer. These tags don't do that. There isn't such a thing as being an expert in meaning, or being knowledgeable about symbolism. Answering a symbolism question can involve anything from close reading to critical theory to explaining a basic grammatical question. Contrast that to a tag such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-canterbury-tales&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;the-canterbury-tales&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;the-canterbury-tales&lt;/a&gt;, where questions with that tag, more likely than not, will require knowledge of &lt;em&gt;The Canterbury Tales&lt;/em&gt; to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tags are broad, unintuitive, and unspecific. For example, meaning can mean anything from &quot;What does word x in this story mean?&quot; to &quot;what is the meaning of character y's obsession with idea z?&quot; Symbolism: does that only refer to questions about objects in stories (e.g. what does the white dress symbolize)? Or does symbolism refer to, to quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/661/111&quot;&gt;a meta post on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Any time there is something that represents more than its literal meaning&quot;? In that case, can I use the symbolism tag for plot-explanation questions, e.g. what does the ending symbolize? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these tags are used inconsistently, which probably is due to them being broad and unspecific. To use some my questions as an example (simply because they're easy for me to find), I've asked many questions that could be tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/meaning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;meaning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt;. But while people have retagged my questions on many occasions, no one has bothered to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/meaning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;meaning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbolism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbolism&lt;/a&gt; tags, perhaps because people don't have a clear definition to use when deciding whether the tags are appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2988/what-is-a-cristopher&quot;&gt;What is a &amp;quot;Cristopher&amp;quot;?&lt;/a&gt; could very easily be a symbolism question--it's about an object--but no one retagged the question, despite the question getting a relative amount of attention. &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2976/mathematics-or-gibberish-understanding-a-description-of-an-alien-message-in-his&quot;&gt;Mathematics or gibberish? Understanding a description of an alien message in His Master&amp;#39;s Voice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2639/why-is-the-future-a-safe-sterile-laboratory&quot;&gt;Why is the future &amp;quot;a safe, sterile laboratory&amp;quot;?&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2989/how-much-french-does-madame-eglentyne-know&quot;&gt;How much French does Madame Eglentyne know?&lt;/a&gt; are all questions about the meaning of a specific passage that received a fair bit of attention, but again, no one felt confident enough to retag the questions. I could go on and compile a whole list; these are just a few of the questions on my profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, looking through the symbolism tag, I see a lot of questions that could also be tagged with the meaning tag.

The topic challenge itself will start on the 1st of September.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The topic challenge has begun - ask your &lt;em&gt;Persepolis&lt;/em&gt; questions now!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;What's a topic challenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the meta posts linked above, and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240634/278659&quot;&gt;this main meta post&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a literature site, but you can't really divorce the song lyrics from the music - that's like saying that we can't discuss the artwork in a graphic novel or comic book because it's not part of the actual words.

So I think that appealing to a definition of literature, which is a broad, vague, and subjective concept, is not the way to go here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question &quot;is oral tradition literature?&quot; is intrinsically unanswerable.&lt;/strong&gt; We've taken two nebulous ideas, &quot;literature&quot; and &quot;oral tradition,&quot; tried to determine if one is a subset of the other, and are for some reason surprised and frustrated that we've gotten a nebulous answer back. Trying to cram that answer into a neat little &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; box is ultimately going to be a fruitless effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We're running face-first into a problem with the name of the site. Unlike on other Stack sites, where &quot;is this about code?&quot; or &quot;is this about pets?&quot; could be used to determine topicality, we &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; in a position to use &quot;is this about literature?&quot; as a litmus test to determine whether something should be on topic. Thinking about whether something counts as &quot;literature&quot; is chimerically misleading, and simply isn't a good test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to deciding scope, what people seem to be forgetting is that while it is trivial to close questions that don't work, it is hard to bring back the people you've alienated by closing broad classes of questions, or to recover the knowledge lost by such closures. So there is no reason not to wait, run experiments, and gather data before making scope decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meta post that everyone is citing does not do that. Rather than explaining why these questions are off-topic, it makes vague comments about the history of poetry. It does not feature any argument as to why music should be off-topic. The arguments that people have made in defense of the meta post are little better. People are appealing to definitions of literature that only they know, and everyone has their own, different reason why these questions should be off-topic. Personally, I would much rather make scope decisions based on actual evidence than this hand-wavy conjecture. This doesn't mean more debate over definitions; it means letting the questions exist and seeing how they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a decent argument that these &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;music&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; questions will become a critical part of the site. I am of course speculating in this answer because I don't have any actual data about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;music&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; questions will do and how they will fit into the site. But I think there's a decent argument that these questions can contribute to this mission in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experience most of us have with reading is reading alone and silently. But that is only one way people read. Reading aloud is just as important as reading quietly. With many forms of art, such as theater or poetry or music, you can not fully understand the work by reading it silently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we have allowed questions about the sound of literature, such as my &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scansion&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scansion&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scansion&lt;/a&gt; questions, they have done quite well. People were enthusiastic about answering these questions, and they were enthusiastic about asking new ones. It's undeniable that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scansion&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scansion&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scansion&lt;/a&gt; tag has a place in our mission as a Q&amp;amp;A site about Literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we were to allow questions about the sounds music makes, in addition to the words contained in music, I suspect that these questions would show that they fit in perfectly with our mission. But I don't actually know; I'm just speculating at this point. Lets give these questions a chance and see how they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, here are some examples of Stack Exchange communities allowing a trial period for certain classes of questions to see how they perform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6074/a-proposal-for-moving-forward-with-rules-as-written&quot;&gt;A proposal for moving forward with Rules as Written&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-09-03T22:18:10.513" LastActivityDate="2017-09-03T22:18:10.513" CommentCount="6" />

That being said, I would like to propose that instrumental music &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be on topic if the title is sufficient for us to analyze. In one sense, a song title isn't all that different from song lyrics. In fact, one test we could use: Would the title suffice as lyrics? If the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; lyrics of the song were its title, would we be able to analyze the song? Can we make meaningful inferences about the intended meaning from the title?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would seem to exclude songs with generic titles (e.g. &quot;so-and-so's 5th concerto&quot;) or titles that don't say much about the song's meaning (&quot;Santorini&quot; by Yanni). Quite simply, these are off topic because the written component eludes analysis. &quot;Santorini&quot; doesn't tell us anything substantial about the intended meaning (it's just the name of a geographic area), and &quot;5th Concerto&quot; isn't an actual song meaning. On the other hand, &quot;I dreamed there was no war&quot; &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; elude analysis - that actually says something about the intended meaning of the song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, questions like this should be about the &lt;em&gt;relationship between&lt;/em&gt; the music and the lyrics (i.e. About the overall meaning of the song), rather than just about the music itself. A question like &quot;who played bass on this song?&quot; or &quot;what key is it in?&quot; would almost certainly be off topic, unless the question directly relates to the song meaning. In other words, if &quot;who plays bass on this song?&quot; doesn't tell us about the song's meaning, it's irrelevant to questions on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on this as a criteria? Is it objective enough to apply consistently, and are songs like this within the site scope?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll also propose that the music is just as relevant to song meaning as the graphics are to comic books and graphic novels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="793" LastActivityDate="2017-09-03T17:59:37.147" CommentCount="6" />

What is its purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why Stack Exchange is different from  a lot of other Q&amp;amp;A sites on the internet is that our sites have scopes. Unlike Yahoo Answers or Quora, where you can ask questions about any topic under the sun, each Stack Exchange site has topics that they always accept questions about, topics that they never accept questions about, and topics that they sometimes accept topics about. Why? Well, it has to do with the idea that Stack Exchange sites are online communities that come together and share knowledge. Too big of a community, and you can't get a critical mass of people who can answer all of the questions in that community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/17/merging-season/&quot;&gt;The right size is usually around the size of a university department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So: the right size [for a Stack Exchange site] might be somewhere around the size of a university department. Somehow, the cultural anthropologists don’t mind sharing a building with the physical anthropologists, and when they both find themselves at the Yale-Harvard football game, you can bet that they’ll sit together and find something anthropological to talk about. Similarly, at Stack Overflow, the Java Entity Bean programmers at insurance companies don’t mind all the iPhone developers asking Objective C questions about the horrible, horrible game they’re working on. Heck, they might become iPhone developers one day. And they both share the humiliation of not being able to fix their uncle’s virus-infested Windows XP machine when they’re home for Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about university departments, you'll know that they don't come together based on strict, objective definitions that everyone agrees on. This is particularly the case for something as subjective as Literature, where I would be shocked if you could find me a department at any university in the world where more than two members of that department shared the same definition of Literature. In fact, if you go to the webpage of any large university department (&lt;a href=&quot;https://english.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here's Harvard's&lt;/a&gt;), you'll find that professors will study everything from &quot;visual media&quot; (David J. Alworth at Harvard) to poetry (Jorie Graham at Harvard) to drama (Marjorie Garber at Harvard) to film (Kathryn Roberts at Harvard). I haven't found any at Harvard during my very cursory search of their department, but I'm sure that depending on the university, yes, there will be professors who study, write about, and teach about music as well. But despite working on all these separate topics, and despite not sharing the same definition of literature, somehow members of literature departments manage to share the same building and (sometimes!) collaborate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All we're trying to do is share the same building and collaboratively build expert Q&amp;amp;A about literature. In that respect, we're just like any university department.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scope is a tool to help us build a community. I worry that in our discussions about formulating a definition of literature that we can use as a scope, we have lost sight of what scope is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's review our efforts to find our site's scope. We started by trying to explicitly define literature. Why don't we all agree that Literature is about text? Because many would argue that such a definition is too broad--it includes works such as instruction manuals, which some argue couldn't possibly be literature. And many would also argue that such a definition is too narrow--it excludes oral literature, and ignores the fact that not all writing is textual (here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a western example&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2584/how-can-the-huexotzinco-codex-be-read&quot;&gt;non-western example&lt;/a&gt;). OK, why don't we define literature as anything with a narrative? Again, some would argue that this definition is too broad (it includes film, for example), while others would argue that this is too narrow (good luck finding a narrative in &quot;The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough.&quot;). It quickly became apparent that coming up with a strict definition was an unproductive exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We then moved on to our current strategy, which is to appeal to some definition of literature that we all agree on but that we won't explicitly define. Except that we don't all agree on this definition! This becomes quickly apparent any time we try to make a scope decision. You can't resolve any sort of conflict of opinion if the only thing you can do when arguing that, say, oral literature is off-topic, is make claims about a definition that you won't actually define. This approach strikes me as equally unproductive as finding an explicit definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think these conversations will be a lot more productive if we can recognize the difference between the following two questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;is x literature?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;is x within our scope?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Defining literature is a interesting philosophical exercise but also a subjective one. There will be topics for which it is impossible to come to a consensus about whether they count as literature. But that doesn't mean that we can't come to a consensus about scope. We just have to separate scope from a definition of literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's return to the idea of a university literature department. What brings a university literature department together? It's not necessarily what they are studying. Some people in a university literature department may study ancient scrolls, others may study pulp paperbacks, others may study music. What brings a university literature department together is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they study things. I guarantee you that everyone in a university literature department knows what close reading is and has used it, in various forms, in their research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true for a math department, or a sociology department, or really any university department sized group of people who are collaborating to produce knowledge. Two math professors may study different things, but I guarantee that they all know how to write a proof. Two sociology professors may study different things, but I guarantee that they all know something about social theory. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Collaborative knowledge disseminating communities, of which university departments are one example, aren't brought together by the things they study but by the methods they use. Rather than trying to find a new way to reinvent the wheel, it seems to me that we should take a page from university department's books and organize our scope around methodology and ways of thinking rather than topic matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this leads to the question: what methods do we want to restrict our scope to? Let's review the history of the site:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we first started out, answers would restrict themselves to quotes from authors. But then we learned about the concept of authorial intent, and that the author's word wasn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close reading wasn't a concept people were familiar with until I introduced it in a self-answered question. But now close reading is slowly working its way into answers and becoming part of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scansion wasn't a concept we were familiar with until I started asking &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scansion&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scansion&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scansion&lt;/a&gt; questions. But now we're starting to use it to analyze poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other concepts that we are unfamiliar with. But I'm sure we will learn them eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are concepts and topics that I have introduced, but that have not proven useful. Oral literature is one example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways to study literature. One way is to study literature by asking questions about plot points (which character did x). There is still a methodology behind those questions (reading, finding the scene in question, and writing an answer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we, the members of this site, created an Q&amp;amp;A website about literature despite knowing next to nothing about the field, one of the things we signed up for was having to learn new things. We are still learning new things, and have no idea when we will stop learning new things. So yes, if we tie our scope to literary methods, our scope will most likely expand for quite some time. But no, this is not a slippery slope because I can think of a million techniques that we will not find useful and will turn away. I doubt, for example, that we will find the concept of motifs or archetypes (used in Mythology), or perhaps the concepts around framing shots in film (Movies &amp;amp; TV) useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tying our scope to literary methods does not mean tying our scope to academic literary methods. Academia has neglected certain faucets of literature, such as reader response criticism and the study of physical books. That does not mean we have to do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To recap:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scope is a tool to build collaborative communities to disseminate knowledge. The most similar analogue to this is a university department.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Collaborative knowledge-disseminating-communities are not organized around what they study but how they study it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We are still learning how to study literature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lets continue learning, and see how we can apply the literary methods we know to songs, and what new literary methods we will learn from studying songs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-09-04T14:54:28.553" LastActivityDate="2017-09-04T14:54:28.553" CommentCount="2" />

It's attracted the people we want to attract. But I am not convinced that &quot;literature&quot; makes an effective scope for our site. It has a lot of problems that we keep running into:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Literature is an incredibly subjective concept, and as a result it's hard to pin down a definition for us to use. For example, there is a valid argument that literature should be a synonym of &quot;art&quot;. Because of literature's subjective nature, there isn't really a way to refute that definition. There are of course a lot of definitions, but there is no one right one that we can all point to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Literature comes with a lot of baggage that we're trying to avoid. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/3149/what-is-the-distinction-between-literature-and-genre-is-such-a-distinction-usef&quot;&gt;part of the definition of literature that many people use includes a value statement&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. some works are of superior quality and count as literature, while some works are not. We're trying to avoid that sort of judgement in our scope, but it's hard to do that if we're basing our scope around a word that has that sort of judgement built in from the beginning. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think perhaps we would be more productive if we used a different word as the basis of our scope. After some thought, I've come to the conclusion that &quot;reading&quot; is the best word to build our scope around. It is sufficiently flexible but also not too broad. It allows for some subjectivity, but not too much. This is why I propose that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Our site is about the theory and practice of &quot;reading&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, what are the sorts of questions you can ask about &quot;reading&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We read books. We can ask questions about books.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's possible to read from memory. With oral literature or a theater performance or, yes, a performance of music, you are reading out loud a text located in your head.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We read some types of visual media (e.g. comic books), but not others (e.g. a painting or a movie).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Computers can read things. You could ask a question about a computer program designed to, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://senderle.github.io/svd-noise/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;make a graph of how emotions in a novel change over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about understanding what you read would be on-topic. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about the physical objects that you read (books) would be on-topic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about the psychology of reading would be on-topic (e.g. what's happening in your brain when you read).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reading things silently is only one way to read. We also read things aloud. Asking about pronunciation, performance, etc. is on-topic here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this definition anticipates a lot of questions that we haven't asked about yet. But I think we would all agree that these are good questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some things that would be off-topic:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most questions about a lot of different types of art, such as cinema.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Question about how to write things, such as how to write computer code or how to write a novel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, perhaps someone will want to come along and make the argument that you can &quot;read&quot; video games, or that you can &quot;read&quot; movies, or that you can read some sort of art form that hasn't been invented yet. I'm not entirely sure what &quot;reading&quot; a movie would look like, but I'm going to assume that questions about &quot;reading&quot; movies are a small subset of all of the possible questions about movies. Which I think would be acceptable to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A scope about reading is pretty flexible but not too flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced that deciding our scope in this way (with a definition) is a productive way to make scope decisions.

The music contributes to the reading of the written story. (Close voters: if you have questions, the wikipedia page explains this).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even ignoring the written story component, there is a story present in the music, and it is possible to ask questions that are the same as if the story was written down, e.g. &quot;who is the character represented by the flute. Why are they represented by a flute&quot;. In this sense, what we are doing is similar enough to reading that we can say we are &quot;reading&quot; the instrumental composition, even though the physical mechanics are different. Like I said, the concept of reading is flexible. But also, there are questions you can ask about music that aren't related to reading, so this is not too flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know which of these two reasons is convincing.

Literary theory and criticism actually has nothing to do with the medium being analyzed. It is a certain class of questions that were mostly developed to interpret things like novels, but which can also be applied to non-novel art.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is of course a bit handwavy.

Closing such meta posts can give a really bad impression. Remember not only the OP but also the countless silent viewers of these questions.

I &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/review/reopen/1866&quot;&gt;voted to leave closed&lt;/a&gt; not so much because of the title as because I think the underlying unranty question is primarily opinion-based. It comes down to &quot;&lt;em&gt;Shelley thinks poetry was great because XYZ; was he right?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Whether poetry is great, or just as good as a bunch of other kinds of art, is (IMO) a question which should fall below this site's &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/844/17&quot;&gt;bar for &quot;primarily opinion-based&quot;-ness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally the question should have its title edited and then get reopened and closed as POB instead. But the choice of close reason is just housekeeping, and unless it gets reopened and upvoted, it's not going to get much more visibility and will end up automatically deleted by the system. So I think that &lt;strong&gt;your question as it stands should remain closed&lt;/strong&gt;. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that with some more edits you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to make it reopenable.

One reason why I'm not a big fan is I don't really think they meet the requirements for good subjective questions. Our subjective questions, such as &quot;what is the meaning of x&quot;, work because answers back their claims up: while there are multiple correct answers, what we are (or should be) judging when we vote on answers is the argument the answers provide about why their conclusions are correct. I don't think the same can be said for these &quot;what is a good summary&quot; questions: two people can provide a summary, but a summary, on its own, does not contain an argument about why the summary is correct, so there isn't really an objective way to differentiate between the summaries; people will be just be voting for the summary they like best. In that sense, these questions are very similar to recommendation questions, which we've closed, because they caused so much trouble the last time people tried to make a Stack Exchange site about literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To elaborate, here's a hypothetical question: &quot;Summarize &lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Here's one summary: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Twelve friends set out on a journey to defeat an evil ruler, Sauron. Along the way, a member of their party is lost to a fearsome demon. At the end, the remaining friends realize that their goals do not align, and split off into different directions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do you evaluate this summary? First, you need to decide whether it has enough detail. Let's say that the question asked for a three sentence summary, and that the summary has enough detail. Then, you need to decide what points are important enough to include in a summary. Perhaps, looking at the summary, you dislike it because it doesn't even mention the ring; there's a very good argument that the ring is the main character of the novel. So you complain about the summary in a comment, and someone responds that, on the contrary, novels are about people and it seems silly to mention some object. And now you've gotten into a debate in the comments. But the thing about the debate is that both sides are equally right. And if there's one thing we know about these subjective debates, it's that they only work when both sides are willing to back up their claims. But comments aren't a good place to back up claims, they're short and hard to see. So include an argument supporting your summary in your answer. But now you're answer is less about providing a summary, and much more of an answer to the related question: what are the most important points in a novel. The take away here is that the question isn't a good subjective question, because it's designed in a way that encourages people to just plop a summary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides, these questions aren't even good or well researched questions: it would be pretty easy to spam the site with a lot of &quot;Give a summary of book x&quot; questions. So in my mind they should be downvoted, even if they aren't closed, because there's no effort involved in asking for a summary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If people think there's a chance that these questions might add value, I'm willing to give them a shot and leave them open (until they start causing problems). But I'm pretty convinced that these will fail for the same reason recommendation questions will fail: they're low quality, easy to spam the site with, and don't really meet the criteria of a good subjective question. My recommendation is to close these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further reading: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-09-16T15:41:43.077" LastActivityDate="2017-09-16T15:41:43.077" CommentCount="4" />

And I know &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; SE sites take a hard line on 'answers as comments' and tend to delete them on sight, directing the commenters to the answer box instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is one of those network-wide 'policies' which is more than a little malleable from site to site, and I suggest that we &lt;strong&gt;discourage but not delete answer-like comments&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why not to delete them?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Deleting them would be removing potentially useful content from the site at very little gain. Surely &lt;em&gt;removing helpful content&lt;/em&gt; goes against what SE is supposed to be all about.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not deleting them enables us to ping the commenters suggesting they leave an answer instead, and enables them to come back and find the info later to jump-start their answer. So by not deleting such comments, we actually &lt;strong&gt;increase the chance of them turning into answers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often &lt;strong&gt;what would be a bad answer is still a useful comment&lt;/strong&gt;: e.g. an unelaborated link to a source of further reading, or an unsupported possible explanation of the issue being asked about.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A common issue on SE is the occasional disconnect between following the letter of the law and using common sense to do what's actually most useful in practice. I've seen various places where people were calling for some action on the grounds of a literal interpretation of something in the help centre, and had to be told e.g. &quot;if it's not causing any problems for the site, don't worry about it&quot; or &quot;look at the big picture of what we're all actually here for, rather than focusing on one particular aspect of one particular policy&quot;. This, in my view, is one of those cases: &lt;strong&gt;we shouldn't be removing useful information from the site if it's not causing any problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Counterarguments would be that comments can't be downvoted (but the voting on answers here isn't always reflective of quality anyway) and that we really need more answers (but deleting answers-as-comments wouldn't achieve that, and in fact would probably be counterproductive for the reasons in the 2nd bullet point above).&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How to combat them?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn't to say that we should welcome or encourage people posting answers as comments. As mentioned above, we should respond to such comments &lt;strong&gt;asking the commenter to turn them into an answer&lt;/strong&gt;. If they don't want to or don't respond for a long time, then it might be acceptable to &lt;strong&gt;turn someone else's comment into an answer yourself&lt;/strong&gt;, preferably with attribution to them for the original idea. Depending on how much extra work you put into the answer compared to the original comment, you might want to make it CW, but there's never any obligation to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've done this a few times here on Lit. Usually I try to put some more effort/research into the answer, so that I don't feel like I'm simply stealing someone else's response.

  <row Id="896" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="895" CreationDate="2017-10-04T08:27:03.607" Score="-4" Body="&lt;p&gt;The problem is is that the question--what is the difference between literary fiction and popular fiction--can't be answered with common sense. The common sense way to answer the question is to look up some one's definition of &quot;literary fiction&quot; and &quot;popular fiction&quot; and write an answer based on that. Your answer cites a definition written by a science fiction author; other answers cite definitions written by the OP. Quite frankly there is no difference between the two. It doesn't matter if the definition comes from a professor of English or someone I met on the street; what matters is whether an argument can be built in support of the definition. An English Professor is as capable of making up a definition without explaining it as anyone else. It is the explanation that matters, not the definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every answer this question has received doesn't seem to take into account that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Definitions change over time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People... not mysterious processes... are responsible for definitions changing over time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not everyone uses the same definitions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the answers write in a passive voice (when you write &quot;it is widely considered that&quot; you don't have to specify who is doing the considering).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been encouraging people to write answers to that question using examples. One reason why I've been doing this is because once you start talking about a specific example of a book, you'll find that defining &quot;literary fiction&quot; and &quot;genre fiction&quot; is a lot more contentious than the answers portray it as. There are debates. People take sides. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;when critiques were posted on the answer I edited to respond to them&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As someone who wrote some of those critiques, in my mind the edits you made haven't really responded to my critiques. For example, you're still using the passive voice in your answer (&quot;Literary fiction is often considered more prestigious&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other people have also left critiques that as far as I can tell have not been responded to. Peter's comment is well worth reading and addressing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many standard elements of literary fiction were also sparked by a standard-setting literary predecessor — James Joyce was one of the first writers to use stream of consciousness, and many writers adapted the technique after him. I don't think this is a distinction between genre and literary fiction. Maybe a handful of writers used stream of consciousness before Joyce, but similarly a few authors wrote epic fantasy before Tolkien, and Arthur Conan Doyle wasn't the first writer of mystery stories.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also goes to show that people vote for different reasons: I can only speak for myself, not the other person who downvoted the question nor for the four people who upvoted it. Voting is intentionally private; other than preventing people from targeting specific individuals, there are no rules about what can be voted on. We can't set policies about what gets upvoted or downvoted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the highest ranked answer neither cites sources nor provides examples, is explicitly a personal opinion, and is, in substance, not dramatically different than my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the one thing going for that answer is it is explicit about where its definition comes from.

I feel this is something we need to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good community is an ongoing dialogue. Right now, our dialog is poisoning interactions and pushing people away. I think it's time for us to set aside discussions of question and answer quality, of sourcing and quoting, of what counts as a good question or a good answer, of what should and shouldn't be downvoted, of what &quot;literature&quot; means and what counts, and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; of how we avoid being &quot;Literature 1.0&quot;, for a moment. For a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why? Because we're bleeding out our orifices.&lt;/strong&gt; People are leaving, and others who might nominally want to participate don't feel like they can. Our active user count has been on a steady, rhythmic decline since the day we left private beta, to an extent that's downright alarming. &lt;strong&gt;This is symptomatic of a problem that &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be addressed. And honestly, I don't think much else matters until it does.&lt;/strong&gt; If we don't have a community, all other discussion is moot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't honestly recall the last positive interaction I've had on the site. Nearly everything I've done here has been frustrating, anxiety-inducing, and unrewarding, especially recently. The site feels impossible to appease. Where normally, on other sites, there's at least a minimal assumption of good faith, and an allowance for &quot;I understand what you mean,&quot; here, everything is subject to incessant deep scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's like we've all decided to discard the idea of building a healthy, welcoming, happy community, and replaced it with a competition to out-literature each other. It's like we've started &lt;em&gt;looking for&lt;/em&gt; reasons to be critical of posts, and of each other. And in that space, we've lost track of the primary and most critical foundation of a healthy community: &lt;strong&gt;ensuring each other walk away from each interaction feeling like it was a good one, and a worthwhile one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen people delete good questions because of harsh, nitpicking feedback. I've been tempted to delete high-voted answers of mine because I couldn't stop getting notifications about small details and choices of words that, really, people &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt;, even if they weren't as clear as they could have been. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen people find themselves unable to &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; questions because they can't figure out how to ask them in a way that lives up to the standards we've set. Even people who are skilled and competent at asking questions have this problem. &lt;em&gt;I've&lt;/em&gt; had this problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen hundreds of inexplicable and unexplained downvotes - I've easily received a couple dozen myself - and hundreds more that came with hostile and unwelcoming explanations. I've almost never seen positive, helpful, constructive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've read thousands of our comments, and found almost no warm, friendly feedback. Little to no &quot;welcome to the community, this is an interesting question&quot; comments exist on this site. Instead, people make demands in comments, then ignore the post, never to touch it again, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; someone bothers to make a good-faith attempt to meet them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize I don't have many sources for these things. Unfortunately, I'm not willing to source most of my examples. I also realize these things happen on any site - but they happen here far, &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more than I've seen elsewhere. In my experience, this is one of the most unapproachable sites I've seen on Stack Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I've been bombarded with examples, lately. They've come out in dialogue, and I suspect they'll continue to come out the longer we talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, truth be told, &lt;strong&gt;if I were a regular user of the site, and not a moderator, I would have left ages ago.&lt;/strong&gt; My long hiatus was because, on some emotional level, I was seeing that this wasn't really a site I wanted to participate in. But it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. I break bookshelves. I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; the target audience. And as a moderator, that means it's time to get my hands dirty. And as a community, that means it's time to get &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a good answer here. I'm not sure what we should do. I know that it's happening - I see it happening, as it has been for a very long time. And besides, this needs to be discussed as a community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, here we go. Here are the questions &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; think we need to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions for Pondering:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When was the last strictly positive, encouraging experience you had on Literature?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Has anyone given you feedback that has solely made you frustrated? &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How often does that happen?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have you gotten inexplicable or unexplained downvotes? Do you feel like you have the tools you need to correct their anonymous concerns?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have you gotten comments that lay out problems you don't feel like you have a way to meaningfully address?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the people on the site?

Why &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; they?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you downvote a post, what, specifically, do you tend to disagree with about that post? How major is that issue?

Of course, your question &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; a recommendation question, but unfortunately first impressions can sometimes affect people's voting. (This is exactly what I was trying to avoid with my comment on your question, btw.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructively&lt;/strong&gt;, your best way of combatting this perception might be to edit the title to move the specific book and author closer to the beginnning. For example, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Has “Foundations of Geopolitics” by Aleksandr Dugin ever been reliably translated into English?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Word order may seem unimportant, but it can help to change the emphasis of the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe people think translation questions should be off-topic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/211/17&quot;&gt;this meta answer&lt;/a&gt; has received more downvotes recently is interesting - it suggests that some people are seeing it for the first time due to your link in comments, and voicing their opinion on it with votes, as is their good right to do. It's still highly-voted enough to be taken as a community consensus, IMO, but apparently the community is no longer as strongly behind it as before. Unfortunately, without comments from the &quot;anti&quot; users, it's hard to tell why. We can only speculate based on comments such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/433/why-did-saq-get-re-translated#comment691_433&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/translation&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;translation&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;translation&lt;/a&gt; questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This doesn't really feel like a literature question to me. There's no question about the actual literature here, simply just a re-translation. That's off-topic imo, so I've voted to close&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructively&lt;/strong&gt;, though, there's not much to suggest here. If some portion of the community feels that translation questions as a whole should be off-topic, then there's literally nothing you can do to your specific question to make it satisfy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you mean by &quot;reliable&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some people feel that your question isn't clearly enough defined. You mention an existing English translation which doesn't satisfy you, but you don't explain exactly why (the text is &quot;extremely poor quality&quot;, in what way? - and is &quot;broken in many places&quot;, how?) You might think it's obvious what makes a translation satisfactory or unsatisfactory, but maybe the voters don't, and therefore think your question is unclear because you're not setting clear goalposts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructively&lt;/strong&gt;, to fix this you could be more specific about why the existing translation you link to isn't good enough (e.g. include some excerpts of badly translated text from it?) and about what you're looking for in a &quot;reliable&quot; translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once again, I don't personally think any of these is a good enough reason to downvote (I haven't voted either way on the question myself yet). But I've tried to examine the question objectively and find possible criticisms of it that &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people might make and which might cause them to downvote it.

I’ve been told a couple of times by mods that I should raise such concerns here if I had them, but I’ll be honest that in itself felt like a challenge rather than a solution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of my difficulty has been that whenever I’ve challenged mods or others on what seemed unnecessary negativity, I’ve had it pointed out to me that essentially ‘thems the rules’ and I can like them or lump them. And I can see their point, so I’ve backed off a lot from the Stack, because if its rules don’t suit me, that isn’t the Stack’s problem...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I also think the stack is doomed the way it’s going. It might &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the rules that discussion belongs in chat not comments, but enforcing that so rigorously that there is no sign of life on a question seems counter productive. On that note it might be helpful for mods to consider that the link between individual posts and chat is pretty clunky in the mobile app... is there even a way to get directly to chat from a question? If mods could more often move the discussion to chat and post a link, chat might get used more, and there would be s breadcrumb trail to the &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I’m aware this is a bit rambling, it’s well past my bedtime, so apologies for any stream-of-consciousness style)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;@zyera’s question talks about building community, yet I’ve been told that the question isn’t &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the people here now, but for later searchers. That seemed to leave no space or incentive for people to keep coming back to try and write and &lt;em&gt;help others write&lt;/em&gt; good answers. Kind of a monastic view of contributors. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I originally wrote a screed here about a particular Q that had been the first that made me feel unwelcome, but as the moderator comments which caused that have since been deleted, there isn’t really much gained by it. However, I will say that the rapid deletion of comments once they are deemed to have served their purpose contributes to the Stack having a relatively sterile flavour, there’s no hint to anyone who stops by later that someone might have had a thought that didn’t make an answer, but might have been someone else’s stepping stone to one. And of course that doesn’t apply universally, but if you’ve seen discussion be wiped away on one Q, you can’t tell if another Q has been similarly swept clean or never attracted any attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="333" LastEditorUserId="333" LastEditDate="2017-10-06T02:34:27.497" LastActivityDate="2017-10-06T02:34:27.497" CommentCount="0" />

Not quite by design, more a natural outcome of a couple of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;? It's a combination of 5 things, and frankly I doubt you (as moderator, or as a site/community) can easily address any of them, sorry:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of effort required to produce good answers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site's subject matter topic requires one to either be a super deep expert (which I'm not - i'm a somewhat informed enthusiast); or a BIG level of effort to participate on a level I prefer to participate at. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm simply finding that I'm unwilling to put in enough effort (partially for reasons in #3) unless the specific question arises on a topic I'm enthusiastic about (e.g. Russian SciFi, or SFF in general) AND someone points the question out to me off-site, often P2P mode (see #5 below for reasons for that).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm only interested in a small portion of the site's content.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My level of enthusiasm is reserved for relatively narrow band of material. Whereas - by the nature of the site's topic - the site &lt;strong&gt;has way too broad of a scope&lt;/strong&gt; for me to be enthusiastic in more than a small sliver of topics/questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a combination of a problem with me as an individual user AND the site as a going concern. Problem is, I suspect many if not most users are more like myself than wide-band-interest enthusiasts or pros, so the site's nature is important factor to the user engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as equivalent of being a programmer that only programs in a very rare esoteric language (that has may be 5 users and 20 questions on StackOverflow), only 2 of which are experts. I doubt that you would be able to engage such a user much on SO. Whereas, on Literature, MANY users are in that same boat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This problem is &lt;strong&gt;severely exacerbated&lt;/strong&gt; by problem #5 below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm personally generally heavily dispirited about SE overall. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has virtually nothing to do with Literature.SE site - Stack's owner and (separately but equally) CM team made me sour on the whole of SE, for a variety of reasons, some related to recent stuff, some years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CMs can give you better stats if you're interested on whether this is just me being a special snowflake, or merely one a wide slice who simply aren't as vocal as myself, and simply silently disengage across the whole network. Given the lack of changes over time, I suspect the disengagement isn't sufficiently large to make anyone give a shrivelfig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As noted in point #1, participation in this site requires heavier level of engagement since good answers here need a lot of effort put in. I don't recall any answers on this site I gave that were &quot;easy As&quot;. As such, the level of de-motivation overall exceeds what is required to make me willing to put in the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm generally against Postmodernism. I detest the whole &quot;Death of an Author&quot; approach to literary criticism and the gleeful disparagement of authorial authority (pun intended). As such, a large chunk of more &quot;professional&quot; - and thus, interesting - content doesn't engage me as much as it would someone else; as most of the modern litcrit seems to be postmodernist. This affects me as a site content's reader, less than answerer, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is more of a problem with me as a user coupled with specifics of site's professional topic. As such, not much that can be done here except write me off even more :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site consensus on tagging (specifically, lack of ability to search for &quot;russian literature&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gilles can elaborate on this far better; basically i'm largely of similar views to him as of when meta discussed tagging a couple months ago but he's far more eloquent :). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This wouldn't be a major problem in and out of itself, BUT, due to specifics of the tagging consensus, it combines with reason #2 above (site has too many topics, and i'm only interested in narrow set) &lt;strong&gt;to make the site very hard for me to use to find interesting questions&lt;/strong&gt;. In short, to find questions about Russian Literature or SFF, I literally have to scan EVERY new question on the site to see if i'm interested in that question's book/author. That's a level of extra effort the lazy/demotivated user in me is not willing to engage in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can we do to make more interactions positive, friendly, and encouraging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure they need to be more positive from my personal past experience. But seriously, how's this different from any other SE sites? Ideally, all interactions should be more constructive and fitting both the letter AND ideally the spirit of &quot;be nice&quot;. Also, people should post well researched and ideally cited answers. And there should be world peace.

The site at best turns into useless but populous pile of junk; or more likely, follows the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Literature site into the land where the shadows lie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last strictly positive, encouraging experience you had on Literature?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monthly topic #1. Lucky for me, the very first one was the very exact book that I love and know well and am one of the few site experts in (yet, surprisingly, there were still enough enthusiasts to ask interesting questions AND vote on the topic).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Has anyone given you feedback that has solely made you frustrated?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not really. There may have been an odd post that got more downvotes or less upvotes than I hoped for, but - for the limited amount of my participation - I was never bummed out or frustrated by any feedback.

I would say though, that however many there were, it was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;far LESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; unexplained and seemingly undeserved downvotes here than on many other sites, including very active and populous ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you like the people on the site?

There's at least a couple of users i got to know on literature that I feel i &quot;like&quot;.

As I’d been posting without problem on ELU for a year and here for several months, I decided to step back to see if I could get a better handle on things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing which makes me feel uncertain about posting is a sense that some of the rules are almost unknowable. If I’m told that a comment/suggestion conflicts with something that’s been previously agreed in Meta, as I have been, what counts as &lt;strong&gt;agreed&lt;/strong&gt; in Meta? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On that occasion I was linked to an answer in Meta as support for a poster’s assertion. So my question is, &lt;strong&gt;when does an answer in Meta become part of the rule-set?&lt;/strong&gt; Or have I come away from that encounter under a misapprehension?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 262 questions on Meta Lit, and many more answers, more yet on Meta SE. I genuinely don’t know how a good citizen keeps up to date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A run of self-answered questions also put me off. I understand that Lit needs to build up a solid base of quality questions and answers, and that the rules of the house perfectly allow for such. I also ‘get’ that the asker may have accepted or up-voted answers other than their own. But if the questions read more like a set-up for a prepared answer than like someone genuinely seeking help, it feels… bogus. I don’t feel moved to put effort into answering a question if I think the author already has an answer ready to roll. So, the site gets a solid Q&amp;amp;A, but risks people being deterred from engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• What can we do to make more interactions positive, friendly, and&#xA;  encouraging?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s been commented more than once that the culture in ELU is ‘different’, but I’ve not found it noticeably different from the other Stacks I frequent eg Writers or Great Outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might be interesting to hear more about what variety exists in cultures across SE. I know a mod once commented to someone I’d been exchanging comments with, how people from that poster’s [named] SE always seemed to really understand how SE worked, which seemed to suggest they felt this Stack was afflicted with too many people who &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; get it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really don’t think that that anyone is intentionally flouting rules, be it about staying on topic, commenting and answering appropriately or ‘being nice’, but perhaps we could &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; do with thinking twice about how someone else may receive our well intentioned utterances and actions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For my own part, when I use comments to seek clarification of the question, I should be clearer that I’m asking because I think the question is &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; and I might want/be able to answer it, rather than because I’m trying to pick holes in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should also make a little allowance for the fact that although we conduct our business here in English, for many posters it isn’t a first language and we may be missing each other’s nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• What are the possible consequences of loosening up on our stringency&#xA;  and strictness?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sky will fall! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the stability of the sky might depend on how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; we loosened up and how &lt;em&gt;uniformly&lt;/em&gt; any changed strategy was applied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, we might manage to get a little discussion going on some of our backlog of unanswered questions, a few comments and a link to chat might be all it needs on some Qs to help people pool recollections about possible story IDs or find somewhere to lodge the idea that they can’t quite form an answer round but which might be the missing piece in someone else’s answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="333" LastActivityDate="2017-10-06T13:59:53.253" CommentCount="1" />

If you want to have a site policy about keeping low-use tags around for reasons that are more about some definition of equality than utility, we won't stop you, but you'll have to do the work of creating the wikis yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a bit of history, the logic that allows single-use tags to exist on other sites is nothing more than a hacky workaround. It was given to Arqade before the system had the &quot;wikis prevent tag removal&quot; logic in place. If anything, we should be turning the single-use tag exception &lt;strong&gt;off&lt;/strong&gt; on other sites, now that tag wikis exist.

It's helpful to remind ourselves on occasion that being friendly doesn't have to be at odds with being right - it's possible to tell someone what's wrong with their answer while still being positive and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a strictly utilitarian point of view, this doesn't matter: the important thing is to provide appropriate feedback, not what spin you put on it. But we're dealing with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; here, and they're less likely to stay on the site if they feel like they're being constantly carped at than if they feel like we're genuinely trying to help them improve their posts. Consider the difference between the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This post is bad and I've downvoted it because XYZ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Welcome to [site]!

If you like, think of it in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/90/17&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;Emrakul&lt;/s&gt; Zyera's three gates&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;criticising someone's post might be true and necessary, but if possible it should also be kind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best advice I can offer on how to do this (as someone who's prided myself for years on my niceness to new users, and refused to succumb to the all-too-common urge to get fed up and lapse into apathy and cynicism) is to &lt;strong&gt;focus on the positives&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're just making a minor criticism of an otherwise good answer, say, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Nice answer, but ...&lt;/em&gt;&quot; If you can't honestly say the answer is nice, but the answerer has clearly put effort into it, say, &quot;&lt;em&gt;You're clearly keen and enthusiastic about the subject, but ...&lt;/em&gt;&quot; &lt;strong&gt;If you can find &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; positive to say, say it.&lt;/strong&gt; This even applies to answers which need to be deleted: e.g. if someone posts a comment as an answer, you can compliment them on an interesting comment while pointing to the Tour and flagging their answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this is especially important for &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; users and those who aren't invested in the site. If you leave a harshly worded comment on one of my answers, I won't really care; if you do it to a newbie, they might never come back. (Also, it doesn't apply to spammers and purely disruptive posts, but that's obvious and is the exception to &quot;If you can find &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; positive to say&quot; above.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;OK, that's got the most important thing out of the way; now to address some of your specific points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Our active user count has been on a steady, rhythmic decline since the day we left private beta, to an extent that's downright alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I disagree (though I'll be interested if you can provide any statistics to support this). We've picked up plenty of new, useful, and enthusiastic active users since leaving private beta, and I don't think more users have left than is normal for an SE site at this stage of its life. (On SFF and Puzzling, the other sites I'm most active on, I don't think &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; private beta users are still highly active - in SFF's case, maybe not even any public beta users.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Has anyone given you feedback that has solely made you frustrated? How often does that happen?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, but I tend to shrug it off. Again, &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; not likely to be chased off this site - the people to worry about are other users, especially new ones, and how &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; react to such feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the only question I've deleted due to frustrating feedback which didn't make sense to me was &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/605/17&quot;&gt;&quot;How many times did Sherlock Holmes commit a crime?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, where that feedback was coming from &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; :-) (This isn't an attempt at finger-pointing, I hasten to add: your comments are almost always really nice and thoughtful. But it might help you to look at things from the opposite side, as the giver rather than receiver or viewer of frustrating feedback.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Have you gotten inexplicable or unexplained downvotes?

If so, is there someone you like based on your interactions with them here specifically? If not, why not? Do they still use the site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. I actually feel like we have a fairly healthy little community here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there anyone you'd like to see post more on the site? Why don't they?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Some people have become less active due to real-life concerns; some people tend to participate mostly in comments, despite my encouragement to flesh them out into answers; ... and, yes, some people apparently don't want to post here because they don't feel like their contributions would be 'literary' enough :-/&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When you downvote a post, what, specifically, do you tend to disagree with about that post?

Do you feel like you have the tools you need to correct their anonymous concerns?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, that's been one of my major frustrations with the site lately. There are a few people that will explain their concerns if they think that there's a problem with a post, but unfortunately there are a lot of other people who won't (even for seemingly high-quality questions and answers), so I'm often left scratching my head as to why someone might consider the post low quality. I may be overreacting, but downvoting without explanation on a post that doesn't have obvious quality problems seems like anonymous sniping at best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a few posts that have 8 - 10 upvotes and 1 - 2 downvotes (none of which were explained). In that circumstance, clearly the majority of readers believe that the post is high quality, which makes the downvotes seem stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems like questions on certain topics (e.g. song lyrics) tend to be particularly likely to draw downvotes for whatever reason, even though the community consensus is that these questions are on topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This point is more controversial, but I strongly believe that people should align their upvotes and downvotes with community-defined quality standards (rather than merely basing their voting on their personal opinion of what constitutes a good question). It's not constructive to downvote questions that meet community-defined question quality standards merely because the voter happens to dislike it for some reason. For example, &quot;I think that this question &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be off topic&quot; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a legitimate reason to downvote (you should take it up on Meta if you think that); &quot;the community has defined this question to be off-topic&quot; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a legitimate reason to downvote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the record, I do realize that my previous point is completely unenforceable given the fact that upvotes and downvotes are anonymous by design, and I'm not suggesting that they de-anonymize voting, I just think that people should try to align their voting with community quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there are things we could do as a community to make it easier to explain votes and to come to a consensus about &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; reasons to vote in certain ways. For example, Stack Overflow has the rather convenient &lt;a href=&quot;http://idownvotedbecau.se/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://idownvotedbecau.se/&lt;/a&gt;, which features a list of reasons that people commonly downvotes and links to use in comments explaining the reasoning. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://idownvotedbecau.se/noresearch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://idownvotedbecau.se/noresearch/&lt;/a&gt; links to an article entitled &quot;I downvoted because research must be done to ask a good question,&quot; which briefly explains what the problem is, why people consider the problem downvote-worthy, and how to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h1&gt;Research is an important first step in solving problems&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Solving problems can be hard work. When we have exhausted our own knowledge, it’s often tempting to simply ask someone else to solve the problem for us. It is very common to find the question we have is one many people have already experienced, and many of these people have already asked about it and have received correct answers in response. Because of the vast amount of information on the internet and Stack Overflow, it often takes just a simple search or two to find them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h1&gt;Why this is a problem&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We have asked a question, but we have not stated what research we have done. This does not mean that we haven’t researched our problem, just that evidence of that research is lacking. People reading our question may not understand, if they know a little research would have found the solution, why we apparently haven’t tried. They may suggest things we have already tried to do through our research, or they may just consider us to be lazy and move on. We risk downvotes and lose opportunities to get correct answers for our question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h1&gt;Why this is worth a downvote&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first part of the text which appears when hovering over the downvote button is “[t]his question does not show research effort”. The first section on the How to Ask page is headed with “Search, and research”. That’s how important research is, not only to Stack Overflow, but to solving problems in general.

I don't have access to the stats but I've been waiting literally years for this site to exist and I'm super happy that it does. I check the site pretty much every day, post questions as they arise and post answers where I feel I can offer useful content. It's depressing to hear that people are leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I go any further, if &lt;strong&gt;anyone&lt;/strong&gt; thinks for &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; reason that &lt;strong&gt;any of my participations here&lt;/strong&gt; are in some way contributing toward this decline &lt;strong&gt;I want people to point fingers at me&lt;/strong&gt;. If I'm rude, or posting empty answers to &quot;play the SE game&quot; then &lt;strong&gt;I want to hear about it and improve&lt;/strong&gt;, because I want the site to thrive and grow far more than I care about my petty faux-intellectualism. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect there are a couple of other people who probably ought to have fingers pointed at them too, which we'll keep quiet about for now but which, if I'm right, we may have to address to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of this stems, I think, from the lack of a crystal clear remit - something that others have mentioned. Personally I don't have a strong feeling that we ought to nail down a particular type of content as &quot;desirable&quot; - the site should work as &quot;books&quot;. But some people do feel differently, and make their opinions known with anonymous downvotes or snarky comments. I have no magic wand for this. As online communities grow so do their identities, but it seems this one is failing to grow due to this problem and I can't suggest a solution, which is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don't get this thing about a lack of substance in some answers. I've said this before but it bears repeating: &lt;strong&gt;a user once dismissed one of my answers as &quot;sparknotes&quot; but that seems to me to be a compliment. SE is not an essay site&lt;/strong&gt;. Concise summaries in the vein of revision notes are exactly what we should be looking for IMO. If you want to go deeper, go somewhere where long-form essays are the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been on the recieving end of it a couple of times and it's dispiriting. But I've been an SE user for a long time and I know that you'll never please everyone and that you take the rough with the smooth. There are some users who I've identified as being problematic in my view and I simply don't answer their questions because I know it's a waste of time. New users won't know that. Again, I don't know what you do about this as it seems a side effect of the way SE sites are built to allow anonymous negativity. If I had my way I'd stop all of SE from downvoting stuff without also leaving a comment but that's not realistic and likely wouldn't work anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To the questions, I've answered those which are relevant to my experience:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When was the last strictly positive, encouraging experience you had on Literature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, when I got some interested comments in response to a question. They weren't all &quot;strictly positive&quot; although one was, but all were encouraging in the sense that they added something useful to the exchange. There is still plenty of good content here by good people and I desperately want to keep that alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anyone given you feedback that has solely made you frustrated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. As I said, I've learned to avoid engaging with certain users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we do to make more interactions positive, friendly, and encouraging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be polite and respectful, especially of the effort put in to answers. Don't downvote - and I think this is really important - unless it's clearly a bad question in terms of clarity or lack of effort or misinformation. Absolutely don't downvote or even comment just because you feel a question isn't a good fit for the site. If that concerns you, take to meta and we'll discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the possible consequences of loosening up on our stringency and strictness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The worst possibility is that we end up like &quot;Books.SE&quot; in an endless loop of story ID questions. I see little risk of that happening since the core of the active user base right now is interested in other, wider applications of the literature tag. We may get a lot of poor quality answers: fine, don't upvote them or, on occasion (if they're clearly &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;) downvote. Some of them may get accepted: fine, that's a built in flaw with the way SE runs. Live with it. I say we relax the strictness and see if we can live with the consequences. It can't be any worse than driving people away with rudeness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I have no constructive suggestions: I wish I did.

As the current Literature SE is &lt;strong&gt;269 days&lt;/strong&gt; old today, I thought it was a good time to make a comparison between the two, to the extent that we can do so using &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6426/literature&quot;&gt;data from Area 51&lt;/a&gt; and hearsay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Questions and answers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, hard numbers from Area 51.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions per day&lt;/strong&gt;: 0.4 for Lit.1, currently 3.2 for Lit.2. We're certainly doing better at generating content in the form of questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answers per question&lt;/strong&gt;: 1.8 for Lit.1, currently 1.4 for Lit.2. We're not doing so well here, but that must be partly because of the fact that Lit.1 allowed recommendation questions, which (at least from my observations on SFF from the days when recommendation questions were allowed there) tend to generate multiple low-effort answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions answered&lt;/strong&gt;: 95% for Lit.1, currently 72% for Lit.2. We &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to be doing spectacularly badly here, but again that's partly due to recommendation questions, which are easier to answer than deeper analysis questions or most of the other questions we get here. All it really shows is that we're getting hard questions, and that people aren't posting poor answers just for the sake of having answers, which is probably a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, we're doing much better on question volume and not so well on answer volume. For harder-to-quantify quality considerations, see below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Traffic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty hard to evaluate with a closed site, but again we have an Area 51 statistic to use. &lt;strong&gt;Visits per day&lt;/strong&gt; were at 230 for Lit.1 and 1087 for Lit.2, so we're definitely doing much better here. It's easy to attribute this to Hot Network Questions - the HNQ sidebar was &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/161595/278659&quot;&gt;introduced in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, well after the demise of Lit.1 - but I don't think that's the only or even the main factor. We haven't had many HNQs in the last several months, and yet the visits-per-day statistic has been steadily increasing for most of that time. The notoriously unreliable &lt;a href=&quot;http://literature.stackexchange.com/site-analytics&quot;&gt;site analytics&lt;/a&gt; data indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/DT1wK.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;91.1% of our traffic comes from search engines&lt;/a&gt;. I think our SEO and/or usefulness to the peoples of the internet is genuinely much better than it was last time around. This is something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Users and reputation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this we can glean a lot more than just one or two numbers from the old Area 51 info.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highest-reputation user&lt;/strong&gt;: a little over 4k rep on Lit.1, over 15k rep on Lit.2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of 3k+ users&lt;/strong&gt;: only 1 on Lit.1, currently 11 on Lit.2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of 2k+ users&lt;/strong&gt;: only 2 on Lit.1, currently 21 on Lit.2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of 1k+ users&lt;/strong&gt;: only 7 on Lit.1, currently 34 on Lit.2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total number of users&lt;/strong&gt;: a little over 1000 on Lit.1, well over 2000 on Lit.2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we have more users and - more importantly - more &lt;em&gt;engaged&lt;/em&gt; users. People are staying on to participate, and seemingly voting more than on Lit.1, leading to a far bigger group of users with high enough rep to take part in moderation of the site. This is more important than it might seem, for the long-term future of the site: if people are committed enough to stay, and are actively taking part by posting or at least voting, then the site's activity isn't likely to nosedive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is much harder to evaluate, as there are no objective statistics for it and I haven't trawled through all the data dumps from Lit.1, but from what I've heard that site's veterans saying, I think we're doing much better this time round. We've banned recommendation questions from the start (yeah, I know I keep saying this), and we've been trying to educate ourselves and each other about what good answers should look like, with IMO at least some measure of success. This is the main reason why I'm not too worried about our low statistics on answered questions and answers per question: our volume of answers is less than on Lit.1, but the quality is higher. My hope is that volume can be built up over time, but a precedent for low quality is hard to fix once it becomes embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I may add to this if I can think of anything more.

But I've come to the conclusion that questions shouldn't be downvoted due to a lack of research. Here's why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of questions that can be answered through a quick Google search. For example, I'm sure that a quick Google search would be enough to find an answer to the question &quot;Why was Bob Dylan awarded the Nobel prize?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, just because other people have written about something doesn't mean that we shouldn't write about it as well. &quot;Why was Bob Dylan awarded the Nobel prize?&quot; is an extremely interesting question, and it would be a pity if people couldn't ask and answer that question on this site just because other people have answered it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And of course, this site gets most of its traffic from search engines. If you can't ask questions that other people are Googling, then you're going to miss out on a huge chunk of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that research is usually a shorthand for &quot;effort&quot;, e.g. spend some time trying to figure out something before you come to us. But I get the sense that this is just effort for effort's sake, rather than effort that leads to improvements in a question. We want people to ask interesting questions such &quot;Why was Bob Dylan awarded the Nobel prize?&quot;--downvoting these questions means that they won't be asked and that we won't have a chance to answer them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there are far better standards that can be used as markers of question quality. (I'm happy to discuss these in chat or a separate meta post. Of course, I've found myself downvoting less and less questions on the site as I slowly learn what types of questions are interesting/lead to good answers. It turns out that most questions are interesting and lead to good answers.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2017-10-17T19:25:02.007" LastActivityDate="2017-10-17T19:25:02.007" CommentCount="1" />

There are many ways of defining literature, but we haven't really come to a decision about which way of defining literature is best for our site. So until we can come to a consensus about say where to draw the line on questions about music, we can't really include a definitive answer in the on-topic guide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why the on-topic guide is actually very cadge about what counts as on-topic, and specifically describes that list as an incomplete list:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, we can give an incomplete list of topics that we mostly agree are on- and off-topic.

The ones in bold text are those that specifically address issues you've raised in your question here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Minor edit to the first paragraph, adding &quot;If you already know the answer, ...&quot; rather than mentioning self-answering as a non sequitur.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Merging the two paragraphs about &quot;what is literature&quot; - no point saying the same thing twice, or in having one of these paragraphs intruding between the two numbered lists.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Removing the sentence &quot;In some circles, the definition of literature has been politicized to exclude certain cultures.&quot; Although well-meaning, this sentence is (ironically) itself politicising; it also comes off as slightly snobbish (&lt;em&gt;we talk about literature better than people in those other circles&lt;/em&gt;) and hostile towards people with different views (some of whom &lt;em&gt;are site members&lt;/em&gt;, and should be 'represented' by the help centre as much as any other site members). Not allowing snobbery towards underrepresented cultures doesn't have to mean antagonising people from those &quot;circles&quot; as soon as they join the site. (I know this change doesn't relate to your question, but that sentence has been making me uncomfortable for a while.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extending the list of types of literature which have been successfully asked about.&lt;/strong&gt; I changed &quot;written stories&quot; to &quot;novels, short stories&quot;, since the former is so broad it could also cover plays and poetry, and also added &quot;song lyrics, oral traditions, and more.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extending the list of &quot;cultural literature&quot; topics in the second numbered item.&lt;/strong&gt; I added literary awards and book collecting here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding a new bullet point for books as physical items.&lt;/strong&gt; This is number 3 in the first list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unifying sentence structure in the bits recommending other sites: &quot;Try asking on ...&quot; in both places, rather than this in one and &quot;you may want to try ...&quot; in the other.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adding a link to the list of all Stack Exchange sites, for people who need to find another one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also thought of a few more possible changes which I &lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt; made in the above text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reshuffling the order. Should the paragraph about searching and self-answering really be right at the start, the first thing people read when they want to know what's on-topic here?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adding links to the help centres of other sites when we recommend people to them. On the one hand, we don't want to send people to ask off-topic questions there; on the other hand, anyone who's already reading &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; help centre is likely to check theirs too before posting there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adding something like &quot;We accept questions about literature from any culture or country in the world.&quot; - a clear statement about our scope to replace the unnecessarily hostile and judgmental sentence I removed in my draft above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't add anything about &quot;content analysis and literature-related technology&quot;, because I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this, and I don't think we've had enough successful questions on these topics to call them on-topic yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="17" LastEditDate="2017-10-23T22:19:22.583" LastActivityDate="2017-10-23T22:19:22.583" CommentCount="8" />

Cheating in literature means plagiarism: in the context of academic work plagiarism is defined as copying the words or ideas of others and not giving proper credit (e.g. a citation). This is because unlike math or physics, work in literature usually involves writing an essay that makes an argument; it doesn't involve the same sort of logical problems that only have one answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone copies our content word for word, it should be pretty easy to use turnitin.com or a simple Google search to figure that out.

So if we treat questions involving cheating differently, we're really only treating questions where the OP admits to cheating differently--given how easy it is to lie on the internet there isn't much point to that.

On one hand, a lot of people seem to like the idea of being a community that creates high-quality content that is useful to others on the internet. On the other hand, to be honest, I don't really see very many people putting in the effort to actually learn about literature. I see a lot of debates about tags or other meaningless issues--I've been part of that debate and share the blame for that--but I don't really see any learning happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our debate over whether music counts as literature is the epitome of that. People came into the debate with very strong feelings, but then didn't bother to put the time and effort into resolving what is a very complicated issue. I doubt that more than two people have read any sort of article on the subject that isn't a wikipedia article or a dictionary page. It's like people think that what they already know is enough and like they shouldn't have to put any effort into learning more. That's a problem, because as we saw at the beginning of the site, we don't really know anything about literature. If people aren't learning or aren't willing to learn, then what does that say about this site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If anything, as a community we've managed to leapfrog straight past learning the tools of literary study and skipped ahead to the antagonistic snobbery. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions that are worth considering:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you read academic articles about literature? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What have you learned since joining the site? Has this knowledge been factual (I learned that [author x] worked as a [profession y])?

I'm not sure what being useful means to people in this community. For me, being useful means taking initiative and learning on your own. For me, being useful means recognizing that learning literary criticism means learning new ways of thinking and writing (e.g. close reading). For me, being useful doesn't mean waiting for others to explain things, but taking initiative and learning things yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest, I can count the number of people being useful on this site on my right hand.

I don't see any particular benefit in having different expletive rules for different parts of the site.

I'm not typically one to blindly follow policy, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; not when it asks me to remove information that doesn't exist elsewhere, so I am happy to go into more detail. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, consider the difference between:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Probably overreading. Plato's ideal-transcendence can't be reduced to a quantifiable dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It may be helpful to start by thinking about whether Plato's ideal model can be reduced to quantifiable dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One comment is &quot;clearly&quot; an &quot;answer&quot; to the question. The other is &quot;clearly&quot; a signpost, or a helpful remark for future answers - a note about content that might be relevant or helpful. But they both contain exactly the same information. So let's ignore the two words that frame the comment like it's trying to be an answer, and focus instead on... well... what it &lt;em&gt;says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And when you look at it without that frame, even &lt;em&gt;you've&lt;/em&gt; left a lot of signposts like that - comments that contain only directions or references for where one should look or start thinking. You're not the only one: they're very common here. And as far as I've seen, they can be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; helpful in guiding answerers in navigating topics that are not necessarily simple or easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The comment you flagged was originally posted as an answer. I had converted it to a comment because it, well, didn't contain nearly enough information to be a proper answer. But removing it outright would have deleted something that at least thrusted &lt;em&gt;towards&lt;/em&gt; an answer, in a way that isn't available on that answer page, and can't be easily searched or found elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the question I ask when I see it flagged is pretty straightforward: does this comment, &lt;em&gt;right now,&lt;/em&gt; contain something valuable? And it clearly does: both for anyone passing through, but especially for someone trying to develop a full answer, it provides a signpost that gives a direction in which to start heading. That's valuable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it's especially valuable on a site where answers are often hard to build. It's especially valuable when these kinds of connections are not ones even any mythical expert is necessarily going to see. And up until someone posts an answer that develops the point, the comment contains no redundant information, and serves only to help the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once an answer is posted that contains and expands upon the information in this comment, or when the question is generally sufficiently answered, I'd say it becomes redundant and should/will(?) be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a policy level, this is not as clear cut as it seems. I would place this under &quot;minor, but transient information.&quot; It's minor: someone's smacked a signpost into the ground, as if to say, &quot;try that way, maybe?&quot; And it's transient: it will only stick around as long as it remains non-redundant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even that equivocation aside, we as a site can't blindly follow Stack policies. We have to be judicious about what we do and why. We are both different and unique as a site in many ways, and much of the Stack framework (and existing policy) was not set up, and &lt;em&gt;will not work&lt;/em&gt; for us. When considering whether that policy is helpful to apply, we need to look not just at what policy says, but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it says that, to see whether it makes sense here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While on other sites, deleting anything answer-y in comments makes obvious sense, for questions like ours, some discourse around the question is often both inevitable and necessary to build good answers. Again, once that discourse becomes redundant, it should be cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In basically all other cases I'm totally on board with Stack comment policy. But I think following it to the letter presents an absolutist view about useful comments that isn't functionally helpful in many cases - for &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;.

This happens because there is an automatic job that removes tags that are used on a single question and that are 6 months old. Single-question tags are common on this site since most questions have a tag for the author of a literary work and a tag for the work itself, and it's natural to have many works and authors with a single question on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A request to remove this automatic job, which has zero benefit and actively hurts the site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/865/can-literature-be-an-exception-for-the-se-rule-that-removes-single-use-tags/904#904&quot;&gt;was denied by Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a way to preserve a single-use tag: you need to create a tag wiki.

By looking carefully at the choices an author makes (in characters, incidents, setting; in the work's stylistic choices and diction, etc.), careful readers often can isolate the tone of a work and sometimes infer from it the underlying attitudes that control and color the story or poem as a whole. The tone might be formal or informal, playful, ironic, optimistic, pessimistic, or sensual. (...) Note that in poetry, tone is often called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He defines &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_M.html#mood_anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; as &#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In literature, a feeling, emotional state, or disposition of mind--especially the predominating atmosphere or tone of a literary work. Most pieces of literature have a prevailing mood, but shifts in this prevailing mood may function as a counterpoint, provide comic relief, or echo the changing events in the plot. The term mood is often used synonymously with atmosphere and ambiance. (...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I would retag the Kafka question with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/style&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;style&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;style&lt;/a&gt; tag.

Many good questions could solicit debates or extended discussion, e.g. in multiple competing answers or in comment chains on the answers.

Do we really need to change the existing close reason? Yes, many of our good questions are subjective and may not have a single correct answer, but the close reason doesn't say &quot;opinion-based&quot;: it says &quot;&lt;em&gt;primarily&lt;/em&gt; opinion-based&quot;. Some questions ARE more opinion-based than others, and the most opinion-based ones (&quot;is X a good book&quot;, for example) don't have any place on our site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/844/17&quot;&gt;As I mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, this close reason works on hundreds of SE sites, many of which are about deeply subjective topics and have their own versions of the &quot;back it up&quot; principle. The only question each site needs to consider is &lt;strong&gt;where to draw the line for what's too opinion-based&lt;/strong&gt;. Our line will be higher than on most sites, but there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still a point beyond which questions are too opinion-based and should be closed. The existing close reason even says this very explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience.&quot; This part could almost be tailor-made for sites such as ours with a large degree of subjectivity. This close reason text accepts that it's OK to be partially opinion-based, but tells people there's a line beyond which questions aren't acceptable - i.e. the line at which &lt;strong&gt;answers can no longer be sensibly backed up.&lt;/strong&gt; Isn't that exactly what we want?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What does &quot;not constructive&quot; mean anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for a question to be &quot;not constructive&quot;? Do questions have to be constructive - and constructing what exactly? This reminds me of the age-old debate about sites such as ours violating the principle that SE questions should be about &quot;an actual problem that you face&quot;. Nobody is going to lose their job if they don't get their question answered on this site. We're not trying to solve any real-life problems here, and any question posted is presumably of interest to at least one person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue isn't that questions aren't &quot;useful&quot;, but that they're not properly answerable.&lt;/strong&gt; We don't care how useful or interesting your question is (at least in terms of its on-topicness for our site; we might downvote it, but not close-vote it).

While the community should step in in instances where tagging practices arent being useful, trying to plan tagging practices from the beginning is usually a bad idea. If you let people just tag questions and create tags when its intuitive to do so, then what happens is you'll get tags that people use and that are intuitive, even if they are sometimes logically inconsistent.

  <row Id="978" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="977" CreationDate="2017-12-30T01:42:17.407" Score="5" Body="&lt;p&gt;There are three main reasons why backing claims up are important on a site about literature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first reason is that &lt;strong&gt;backing claims up is crucial to deter false information.&lt;/strong&gt; Fake news is a huge problem on the internet because anyone can write falsehoods anonymously on the internet. Although the media attention has focused on hostile actors deliberately spreading false information, a lot of false information online comes from well meaning people who simply misremember a critical fact or misunderstand a central argument. Backing claims up solves this: it makes it very easy for a reader to go back,  retrace your work,  and make sure your answer is correct (and leave a comment if it isn't). If an answer isn't backed up,  verifying claims and telling false information from truth becauses infinitely more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that &lt;strong&gt;students of literature, and people conducting rigorous literary research, are one of our site's main audiences&lt;/strong&gt; (although they are not our only audience). If you think about why someone would google &quot;what does Moby Dick symbolize&quot;, it should be obvious that students would be at the top of the list. If you think about who would be likely to write expert questions and answers, it should be obvious that someone who had just written, say, a paper would be at the top of that list. As the study of literature is based on the art and practice of making compelling arguments, answers that don't back their claims up are of little use to one of our site's main target audiences. Imagine you're writing an essay on a book. An answer that quotes or otherwise references a specific passage of that book will be much more helpful than an answer that doesn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally,  the most important reason is that unlike many stack exchange sites, &lt;strong&gt;the Literature Stack Exchange is about a subjective topic&lt;/strong&gt;:  literature.  There are a lot of questions on this site,  such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/4839/do-guildenstern-and-rosencrantz-deserve-to-die&quot;&gt;Do Guildenstern and Rosencrantz deserve to die?&lt;/a&gt;, where the correct answer is often a matter of opinion. For such questions,  the only way to make them work in Stack Exchange's Q&amp;amp;A structure is if answers back their opinions up with arguments. If these questions are seen as a place for anyone to post their unsupported opinions,  then the question just turns into a poll where people vote for the answers they personally agree with.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/17/real-questions-have-answers/&quot;&gt;Polls do not work on Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. But if people write answers where they explain why they believe in their opinion,  then answers can be evaluated on the basis of who has the most compelling explanation,  and a genuine sharing of perspectives can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related and useful reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20091009101403/http://moms4mom.com/back-it-up/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The original Moms4Moms Back It Up! rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2018-01-31T04:01:05.993" LastActivityDate="2018-01-31T04:01:05.993" CommentCount="5" />

Obviously this needs to be clarified, because &quot;low quality&quot; without context can be a highly subjective evaluation. In the context of this meta post, you seem to mean &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unexplained&lt;/em&gt; answers&lt;/strong&gt;. I'll call them that rather than &quot;low quality&quot; answers below, just for clarity and to make sure we're all on the same page.&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Standard guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/trusted-user&quot;&gt;help centre&lt;/a&gt; has some guidance on when answers should be delete-voted:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should I vote to delete an answer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You may vote to delete answers in the following cases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The answer is extremely low quality: There is little to no scope for improvement&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The answer doesn't attempt to answer the question; it may be a comment or a separate question altogether.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The type of answers you're talking about here certainly &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; attempt to answer the question, just without explanation. And there's certainly scope for improvement: any unexplained answer can be turned into an explained one simply by, well, editing in an explanation. So according to the standard guidelines for answer deletion, unexplained answers don't need to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that help centre page is the same on every site in the SE network, so it doesn't take account of any special problems we may have here due to subject material or site history. I know other sites have specific rules on deleting certain types of answer which aren't the same everywhere. As noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/5222/278659&quot;&gt;this main meta FAQ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the criteria for deletion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] For answers, any post that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/163733/278659&quot;&gt;not an answer&lt;/a&gt; (should be a comment, doesn't answer the question, etc.) should be deleted. Answers that are wrong or that dispense poor advice should be downvoted, not deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These are general guidelines; some communities in the network may uphold more specific reasons to delete posts or not. For example, on Puzzling.SE, answers to a puzzle without explanation are subject to deletion and some technical sites will delete answers which are not only wrong but also harmful when tried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Is this enough of an issue that we need new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are we having a problem with too many unexplained answers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing, we're not actually getting many answers at all on this site! Our question count and answer count are roughly equal, and have been so for a long time; on every other SE site I know about, there are way more answers than questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the answers we are getting, most of them are explained (to varying levels of detail), but there are also occasional one-liners and unsupported speculation. I don't have any exact statistics, but it must be &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; less than half or even a third of our total answer content. Evidently your campaign of downvoting and commenting on such answers has been somewhat effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the extent that there is a problem, are votes failing to deal with it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The usual solution to an answer which is bad but not NaA is to &lt;em&gt;downvote&lt;/em&gt; it, reserving deletion for extreme cases such as gibberish or non-answers. A negative score sends the desired message &quot;this isn't good content&quot;, while allowing the post to be improved so that votes can be reversed. This only fails when people aren't downvoting enough: if harmful content is getting upvoted, &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; when it's time to implement more drastic solutions such as new deletion policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When someone posts a new answer without explaining it, it tends to attract downvotes pretty quickly. I can't think of any examples of recent unexplained answers which have been particularly well-received or highly-voted. The current community votes responsibly, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That still leaves the old answers from around the private beta period, some of which &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; unsupported and yet higher-voted than they would be if posted today. However, when these answers are bumped to the front page by edits, they do tend to accrue the downvotes that they should have had originally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the main problem here is &lt;strong&gt;unexplained answers from private beta which were upvoted then and haven't had enough downvotes since&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a finite set, which (in comparison to the site's total volume) is only going to shrink over time. I wouldn't necessarily be averse to mods slapping post notices on some of those old answers, but the problem isn't big enough to merit outright deletion of swathes of our content. Especially since the policy you propose would also mean deleting a lot of new answers as they come in, which we're already dealing with satisfactorily using votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just be liberal with downvotes and comments, and hope that people edit to improve.&lt;/strong&gt; That &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; happen - I've seen it - and it wouldn't have if we'd deleted those answers instead of commenting to request improvement. And if these answers &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; improved, and remain downvoted instead, then it sends a visible signal that unexplained answers aren't well-received here, which deletion wouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="17" LastEditDate="2018-01-16T14:17:39.050" LastActivityDate="2018-01-16T14:17:39.050" CommentCount="10" />

There are a lot of questions on this site,  such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/4839/do-guildenstern-and-rosencrantz-deserve-to-die&quot;&gt;Do Guildenstern and Rosencrantz deserve to die?&lt;/a&gt;, where the correct answer is often a matter of opinion. For such questions,  the only way to make them work in Stack Exchange's Q&amp;amp;A structure is if answers back their opinions up with arguments. If these questions are seen as a place for anyone to post their unsupported opinions,  then the question just turns into a poll where people vote for the answers they personally agree with.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/17/real-questions-have-answers/&quot;&gt;Polls do not work on Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. But if people write answers where they explain why they believe in their opinion,  then answers can be evaluated on the basis of who has the most compelling explanation,  and a genuine sharing of perspectives can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our experience in the private beta shows that in practice, our site does not work unless answers provide some sort of justification. Without that rule, questions such as &quot;what is the meaning of the pickle jar in Ethan Frome&quot; become a free for all where anyone can post anything. Our experience also shows that requiring justification actually results in a diverse range of responses and answers: we're requiring justification, but there's freedom about what justification actually means. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/40799944#40799944&quot;&gt;BESW writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Stack's basic &quot;Back it up!&quot; principle should, in theory, be sufficient for lit.se as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in my experience a significant number of Stack users are members of that part of the wider population which has not been trained in the difference between assertion and support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This means most attempts to ask that support be added to an answer are interpreted as a challenge to the user's expertise, and that creates a defensive attitude which opposes the support-based culture underlying the best Stack content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've seen it on multiple Stacks, where opinion-based subjects are considered either free-for-all open game for unsupported speculation, or are considered impossible to answer within the Stack structure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Literature can't succumb to that false dichotomy or it will crash and burn where some other Stacks can still survive with limited function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But we don't actually need to invent extra policies for answering questions here, at least not yet. The simple notion that claims need explicit support--ANY kind of support--should be enough to get us off the ground, with multiple answers providing multiple critical lenses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This attitude (that claims need support, but not specifying the kind of support) creates a space for responses ranging from reader response (experience-based support is a major part of several Stacks already! see rpg.se, parenting.se, gardening.se, etc) to authorial intent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point I'm trying to make here is that the principle that answers need to be backed up is something so important that it shouldn't be left up to votes. It's a fundamental requirement for this site to work, and answers that don't back claims up stick around, clutter up the site, and because people post content based on what has already been posted, encourage more poor answers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm flexible about how this should be implemented. I would be OK with putting a post notice on answers that don't provide support, leaving them up for a month to give the writer a chance to update the answer, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5170&quot;&gt;deleting the answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we really shouldn't be leaving these answers up: they aren't just noise, they're antithetical to everything that allows a Stack Exchange about literature to exist. Votes should be for when an answer is incorrect, or bad. But an answer not providing justification isn't a bad answer, rather, it's a failure to participate in the norms that make this site possible. These answers should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user111" LastEditorDisplayName="user111" LastEditDate="2018-01-17T20:20:13.363" LastActivityDate="2018-01-17T20:20:13.363" CommentCount="10" />

Of course we should be deleting bad answers: Zyerah makes an excellent point that &quot;this isn't reddit&quot;. So: what do we delete?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where we run into trouble compared with other SE sites. For computing or maths based sites there is often a definitive &quot;correct&quot; answer which can be proved by a chain of logic. For science, it is often straightforward to provide a reference, even if it's just a page in a textbook. Same goes for humanities and social science, except here there's more debate over what's actually &quot;correct&quot;. However, while that makes the Q&amp;amp;A format messy, it's not hard to provide an actual reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some answers though, especially in History SE, that don't. Yet I don't feel they're bad answers. Why? Because they make statements which are relatively self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, we face a double issue. Not only can we provide a lot of &quot;self evident&quot; answers by close reading and providing examples, but it's much harder to provide an actual reference. Most people don't have books of literary criticism littering their homes. Even in cases where you can find relevant, essays, papers and thesis on the web, it's often hard to provide a definitive reference, because Literature is subjective, and opinions differ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple of simple examples from my own answers. There two:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/3042/the-meaning-of-the-rest-is-silence-in-hamlet/3045#3045&quot;&gt;The meaning of &amp;quot;The rest is silence&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Hamlet&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2478/language-in-a-view-from-the-bridge/2481#2481&quot;&gt;Language in A View from the Bridge&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Provide no references, because they are based on my own close reading of the text. Whereas these two:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/5364/why-is-this-poem-by-paul-auster-entitled-spokes/5367#5367&quot;&gt;Why is this poem by Paul Auster entitled &amp;quot;Spokes&amp;quot;?&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/1664/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-rescue-of-tashtego/1665#1665&quot;&gt;What is the meaning of the rescue of Tashtego?&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Provide a single reference, but contain additional opinions which I've either arrived at myself of gleaned from forgotten, unreferenced sources?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that make those answers of no value? I would argue that it does not. In fact, looking at a number of my answers while I tried to find examples, I see that most of them are not referenced and, some, indeed are not based on close reading. Here, for example, is an accepted answer that probably got that way because it's pretty obvious to anyone who stops and thinks for a while about the question and the content of the text: &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/1230/what-was-the-irony-of-the-end-of-lord-of-the-flies/1231#1231&quot;&gt;What was the irony of the end of Lord of The Flies?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subjective nature of literature and the objective demands of the site have lead us into some nasty blind alleys. I once composed an answer based on an amount of commonly-accepted historical practices, which got a negative reception because it was &quot;not referenced&quot;. Yet if you're asking - to make a frivolous example - a question where the answer depends partly on the Catholicism of the Pope, you can't really expect someone to find a reference stating that the Pope is Catholic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This little rant isn't really much of a concrete answer, because I don't know what the answer is to reconciling the message and the medium here. All I know is that I enjoy participating on the site, and I would like to continue doing so. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;- We need a better definition of what constitutes &quot;a good/bad answer&quot;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;- That has to go beyond referencing/supporting the claims in the answer    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastActivityDate="2018-01-29T17:23:32.223" CommentCount="12" />

For that purpose, the only thing we need to worry about is the top statistic, questions per day. (Of course, as &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; stated in that post, success and graduation are not the same thing.) Much more detailed and useful stats can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/site-analytics&quot;&gt;site analytics&lt;/a&gt; (currently visible only to you, me, and the mods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We're still doing pretty well.&lt;/strong&gt; With the caveat that Area 51 stats aren't a great measure, I did do some analysis a few months ago of how we're doing, with reference to the previous failed incarnation of Literature: &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/913/17&quot;&gt;Lit.1 and Lit.2 - a comparison&lt;/a&gt;. Make of this what you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality &gt; quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't think this needs much explaining.

See also my proposal at &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/584/17&quot;&gt;Reward system for answering unanswered questions?&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately, so far this hasn't been very successful: when people start bounties on Lit to attract answers, they tend to get crickets.

As a StackOverflow user, I'm aware that on that site, showing your own attempts to answer a question is seen as important. And rightly so: there's an overwhelming volume of posts on that site, many of them of very poor quality. Asking for basic research before posting is a sensible way to combat the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not something, as far as I'm aware, that we've ever touched on here. Certainly, I've answered a number of questions myself which could just have easily been answered by a quick trip to a search engine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm of the opinion that there's currently no need to set a bar of personal effort before accepting a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have an issue with post volumes. Indeed, more traffic (and more Q's and A's) are good on a beta site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The somewhat subjective nature of the questions we accept means there is value in someone posting a low-effort question and having someone here collating information from various sources into a single answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lack of research&quot; is, in itself, a more subjective bar here. For programming questions, there's already a wealth of data on the internet. For literature questions, there's less available, and more of it remains in available only via traditional paper publishing. On my question, for example, the commenter felt I perhaps ought to have consulted a physical schema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my personal feelings, this seems an issue worthy of community discussion so that we can set a policy.

Let's instead concentrate on trying to fix things which &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, or could be, problems for our site. I'd say the problem with question volume, if there is one at all, is more that we have too &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; questions than too many. But let me expand on why I don't think this is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not everyone is equally skilled at researching.&lt;/strong&gt; What you or I might think of as a trivial question because the answer is so 'easy' (for us) to find, someone else might not be able to figure out for themselves. And that someone else, who isn't greatly skilled at researching questions about literature, is precisely the sort of person for whom this site will be useful - either as an asker themselves or as a passive reader of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you learn more from a good answer than you could have from self-research.&lt;/strong&gt; Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/6228/17&quot;&gt;this question of mine&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. As the comments show, the short answer to the question can be found on Wikipedia. I almost deleted it after seeing that, but I'm glad I didn't because of the outstanding answer it received - going far above and beyond what was necessary to answer the question. So &quot;it's easy to find the answer from Google&quot; isn't always the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short: &lt;strong&gt;people are learning from these questions, and that makes them useful&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if a question doesn't include the research the OP did to try to answer it, it can still be an interesting question to people who couldn't find the answer themselves, and its answers might teach something even to people who could.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Requiring self-research is a good way to weed out the wheat from the chaff on sites which have too many questions to handle, like Stack Overflow or Maths SE. If you get several hundred questions every day and a goodly number of them are bad enough not to be worth answering, then by all means add extra quality requirements. But our site isn't one of those. It's possible for a single user to see and vote on every question that comes in. Without a &quot;too many bad questions&quot; problem, we don't need a &quot;require self-research before posting&quot; solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2018-04-17T11:47:22.893" CommentCount="1" />

If you want it &lt;em&gt;migrated&lt;/em&gt; here, rather than &lt;em&gt;reposted&lt;/em&gt; here, I can throw a flag up on that question asking them to move it here. It's hardly a bad question, and it would be nice to have more examples of good story-ID questions on site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm suggesting this because, for the reasons below, I'm not sure this is a good question to cross-post. Let me know if that works for you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cross-posting is, in my experience, generally okay if a question is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;acceptable on multiple sites,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the question is of very high quality,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you're asking on one site at a time,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the other site didn't give you the kinds of answers you wanted,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the other site is a &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; fit for the kind of question you're asking,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bonus points if the question is likely to elicit different answers from the two communities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question you're asking about, in my eyes, is: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/what-do-we-think-about-story-identification&quot;&gt;Acceptable here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has a potential issue with quality. It's not that it's a poorly-asked question, and as far as story-ID questions go this is a key example of a good one. But by site consensus, for the reasons described in the prior link, story ID questions are not regarded as the prime example of a high quality question here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Identification questions are like... The cabbage, radishes and shredded carrots that some sushi shops put on the platter before stacking up the meat &amp;amp; rice. They make the plate look nice and full, and they're something to chew on once you've eaten all the meat...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You asked on that site, didn't get the answer you were looking for, so asking on here is, in my mind, okay by this point. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Didn't get an answer on it, moot point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SF&amp;amp;F is... just about as good a fit for this question as Literature would be, honestly. So by this point it's kind of iffy, too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's an ID question, so the answer is the same regardless of where it's posted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastEditorUserId="58" LastEditDate="2018-05-09T12:13:21.223" LastActivityDate="2018-05-09T12:13:21.223" CommentCount="0" />
